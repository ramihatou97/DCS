---

## FIX #1: Add Demographics Section

### Problem
DCS app output has NO demographics section (0% accuracy on demographics).

### Solution
Modify the narrative generation prompt to explicitly request demographics.

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 797-829

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are an expert neurosurgery attending physician. Generate a comprehensive discharge summary from the data and notes below.

KEY DATA:
${JSON.stringify(conciseData, null, 2)}

CLINICAL NOTES (truncated to key sections):
${truncatedNotes}

${pathologyGuidance}

${learnedPatternsGuidance}

${knowledgeGuidance}

WRITING GUIDELINES:
- Tell the patient's clinical journey: presentation â†’ diagnosis â†’ intervention â†’ outcome
- Synthesize multiple sources (attending/resident/consultant notes) into coherent narrative
- Use chronological flow with specific dates
- Professional medical prose for attending physicians
- Deduplicate repetitive mentions (e.g., "coiling" mentioned 5x = describe once)
- Emphasize safety-critical info (anticoagulation status, bleeding risk)
- PT/OT assessments are gold standard for functional status

REQUIRED SECTIONS:
1. CHIEF COMPLAINT: 1-2 sentence presenting problem
2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Chronological narrative from symptom onset through admission
3. HOSPITAL COURSE: Day-by-day narrative including procedures, complications, treatment response
4. PROCEDURES: List with dates and operators
5. COMPLICATIONS: If any, describe with management
6. DISCHARGE STATUS: Functional status (GCS/mRS/KPS), neuro exam, medications, discharge destination
7. FOLLOW-UP: Clinic appointments, imaging, instructions

Generate comprehensive discharge summary:`;
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are an expert neurosurgery attending physician. Generate a comprehensive discharge summary from the data and notes below.

KEY DATA:
${JSON.stringify(conciseData, null, 2)}

## FIX #2: Enhance Medication Accuracy

### Problem
DCS app has wrong medication frequencies (e.g., oxycodone q4h vs q6h).

### Solution
Add explicit medication accuracy requirements to the prompt.

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 797-829

**ADD AFTER "WRITING GUIDELINES:"**

```javascript
CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:

1. MEDICATION ACCURACY:
   - Extract ALL discharge medications from the notes
   - Preserve EXACT dosages and frequencies - do NOT modify
   - Copy medication instructions VERBATIM
   - Include route of administration (PO, IV, SQ, etc.)
   - Specify duration for time-limited medications (e.g., "x 4 more weeks")
   - If a medication is mentioned multiple times, use the MOST RECENT/DISCHARGE dosing
   - Format: "Medication name dose route frequency (duration if applicable)"
     Examples:
     * "Vancomycin 1g IV q12h x 4 weeks"
     * "Oxycodone 5mg PO q6h PRN pain"
     * "Metoprolol 25mg PO BID"

2. DATE ACCURACY:
   - Verify all dates against note timestamps
   - Cross-check POD calculations: POD X = Admission Date + X days
   - If a procedure date seems inconsistent, recalculate from POD
   - Format all dates consistently (MM/DD/YYYY or Month DD, YYYY)
   - Double-check: Does "POD 14" match the calculated date?

3. NEUROLOGIC EXAM ACCURACY:
   - Document detailed motor exam (strength by muscle group with grades)
   - Include sensory level and distribution
   - Document reflexes with grades
   - **CRITICAL: Capture any late neurologic recovery or improvement**
   - Look for phrases like "finally seeing improvement", "trace movement", "recovery noted"

4. COMPLICATION COMPLETENESS:
   - List ALL complications mentioned anywhere in the notes
   - Include timing (POD or date)
   - Describe management approach
   - Note resolution status (resolved, ongoing, improving)
   - Don't miss complications described indirectly (e.g., "hypotensive requiring pressors" = neurogenic shock)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Medication accuracy: 60% â†’ 100% (+40%)
- Date accuracy: 85% â†’ 95% (+10%)
- Overall: 55% â†’ 65% (+10%)

---

## FIX #3: Fix Functional Status Extraction

### Problem
DCS app missed late neurologic recovery (stated "LE 0/5" when ground truth was "L leg 1/5").

### Solution
1. Don't truncate source notes (remove truncation)
2. Enhance extracted data summary to include detailed neuro exam
3. Add emphasis in prompt

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 646-673

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
function summarizeExtractedData(extracted) {
  return {
    patient: {
      age: extracted.demographics?.age,
      sex: extracted.demographics?.sex
    },
    admission: extracted.dates?.admission || extracted.dates?.admissionDate,
    discharge: extracted.dates?.discharge || extracted.dates?.dischargeDate,
    diagnosis: extracted.pathology?.primaryDiagnosis || extracted.pathology?.type,
    procedures: extracted.procedures?.procedures?.map(p => ({
      name: p.name || p.procedure,
      date: p.date
    })) || [],
    complications: extracted.complications?.map(c => ({
      name: c.complication || c.name,
      severity: c.severity
    })) || [],
    medications: extracted.medications?.slice(0, 10).map(m =>
      `${m.name || m.medication} ${m.dosage || ''} ${m.frequency || ''}`.trim()
    ) || [],
    discharge_status: {
      destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
      mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
      kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
      gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs
    }
  };
}
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
function summarizeExtractedData(extracted) {
  return {
    patient: {
      name: extracted.demographics?.name,
      mrn: extracted.demographics?.mrn,
      age: extracted.demographics?.age,
      sex: extracted.demographics?.sex || extracted.demographics?.gender
    },
    dates: {
      admission: extracted.dates?.admission || extracted.dates?.admissionDate,
      discharge: extracted.dates?.discharge || extracted.dates?.dischargeDate,
      surgery: extracted.dates?.surgery,
      length_of_stay: extracted.dates?.lengthOfStay
    },
    attending: extracted.demographics?.attending || extracted.demographics?.attendingPhysician,
    diagnosis: extracted.pathology?.primaryDiagnosis || extracted.pathology?.type,
    procedures: extracted.procedures?.procedures?.map(p => ({
      name: p.name || p.procedure,
      date: p.date,
      operator: p.operator
    })) || [],
    complications: extracted.complications?.map(c => ({
      name: c.complication || c.name,
      severity: c.severity,
      date: c.date,
      management: c.management
    })) || [],
    medications: extracted.medications?.map(m => ({
      name: m.name || m.medication,
      dose: m.dosage || m.dose,
      frequency: m.frequency,
      route: m.route,
      duration: m.duration
    })) || [],
    discharge_status: {
      destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
      mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
      kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
      gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs,
      // ADD DETAILED NEUROLOGIC EXAM
      neuro_exam: {
        motor: extracted.functionalScores?.motorExam || extracted.discharge?.motorExam,
        sensory: extracted.functionalScores?.sensoryExam || extracted.discharge?.sensoryExam,
        reflexes: extracted.functionalScores?.reflexes || extracted.discharge?.reflexes,
        cranial_nerves: extracted.functionalScores?.cranialNerves,
        // CRITICAL: Include any recovery events
        recovery_notes: extracted.functionalScores?.recoveryNotes || []
      }
    }
  };
}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Functional status: 62.5% â†’ 90% (+27.5%)
- Overall: 65% â†’ 70% (+5%)

---

## FIX #4: Remove Note Truncation (CRITICAL)

### Problem
The `truncateSourceNotes` function (lines 679-711) may cut out critical information like late neurologic recovery.

### Solution
**Option A (Recommended):** Increase truncation limit from 15,000 to 30,000 characters  
**Option B (Aggressive):** Remove truncation entirely

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 792-793

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
const conciseData = summarizeExtractedData(extractedData);
const truncatedNotes = truncateSourceNotes(sourceNotes, 15000);
```

**AFTER (Option A - Safer):**
```javascript
const conciseData = summarizeExtractedData(extractedData);
const truncatedNotes = truncateSourceNotes(sourceNotes, 30000); // Increased from 15000
```

**AFTER (Option B - More Aggressive):**
```javascript
const conciseData = summarizeExtractedData(extractedData);
// Don't truncate - pass full notes to ensure no information loss
const truncatedNotes = sourceNotes;
```

**Rationale:**
- Robert Chen case has 741 lines of notes
- Truncation at 15,000 chars may cut out POD 20 recovery notes
- LLMs can handle 30,000+ characters easily
- Better to pass more context than risk missing critical information

**Expected Impact:**
- Functional status: 90% â†’ 100% (+10%)
- Complications: 25% â†’ 50% (+25%)
- Overall: 70% â†’ 75% (+5%)

---

## FIX #5: Enhance Extraction Prompt for Complications

### Problem
DCS app missed neurogenic shock and UTI (50% of complications).

### Solution
Enhance the extraction prompt to emphasize ALL complications.

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 395-609

**FIND THIS SECTION (around line 530):**
```javascript
"complications": [
  {
    "name": "complication name",  // e.g., "vasospasm", "hydrocephalus", "CSF leak"
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" or null,
    "severity": "mild" | "moderate" | "severe" or null,
    "management": string or null  // How it was treated
  }
],
```

**ADD BEFORE IT:**
```javascript
COMPLICATION EXTRACTION GUIDANCE:
- Extract ALL complications, even if not explicitly labeled as "complications"
- Look for:
  * Infections (wound, UTI, pneumonia, meningitis)
  * Hemodynamic issues (hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias)
  * Neurologic changes (new deficits, seizures, altered mental status)
  * Respiratory issues (pneumonia, respiratory failure, reintubation)
  * Vascular events (DVT, PE, stroke)
  * Wound issues (dehiscence, CSF leak, hematoma)
  * Medical complications (MI, renal failure, electrolyte abnormalities)
- Infer complications from clinical descriptions:
  * "Hypotensive requiring pressors" â†’ Neurogenic shock or septic shock
  * "Febrile with elevated WBC" â†’ Infection (specify type if mentioned)
  * "New weakness" â†’ Neurologic complication
  * "Desaturating, requiring intubation" â†’ Respiratory failure
- Include timing (POD or date), management, and resolution status

```

**Expected Impact:**
- Complications: 50% â†’ 100% (+50%)
- Overall: 75% â†’ 80% (+5%)

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Test Case: Robert Chen (Spinal Cord Injury)

**Source:** `summaries.md` (lines 1-741)

**Ground Truth (from Gemini - 98.6% accuracy):**
- Demographics: Name, MRN, dates, attending âœ…
- Principal diagnosis: C5-C6 bilateral facet dislocation with incomplete SCI (ASIA C) âœ…
- Secondary diagnoses: 11 items including neurogenic shock, PE, MRSA infection âœ…
- Procedures: 5 procedures with exact dates âœ…
- Complications: 4 complications with timing âœ…
- Medications: 11 medications with exact dosing âœ…
- Functional status: Detailed neuro exam including POD 20 recovery (L leg 1/5) âœ…
- Discharge destination: Regional SCI Center âœ…

**Testing Steps:**

1. **Apply all Phase 1 fixes**
2. **Run DCS app on Robert Chen case**
3. **Compare output to ground truth**
4. **Calculate accuracy scores:**
   - Demographics: X/8 fields
   - Diagnoses: X/11 secondary diagnoses
   - Procedures: X/5 procedures
   - Complications: X/4 complications
   - Medications: X/11 medications
   - Functional status: X/8 elements
   - Overall: X/56 total items

5. **Verify critical fixes:**
   - âœ… Demographics section present?
   - âœ… Secondary diagnoses section present?
   - âœ… Oxycodone frequency correct (q6h not q4h)?
   - âœ… I&D date correct (Oct 4 not Oct 2)?
   - âœ… POD 20 recovery documented (L leg 1/5)?
   - âœ… Neurogenic shock listed?
   - âœ… UTI listed?

**Success Criteria:**
- Overall accuracy: 70%+ (39/56 items)
- Zero critical errors (wrong dates, wrong dosages)
- All 10 critical failures from comparative analysis fixed
