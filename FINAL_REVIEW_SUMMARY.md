- Ran production build process
- Identified and resolved build errors
- Verified final bundle optimization

### 3. **Functionality Testing**

- Checked for security vulnerabilities
- Reviewed error handling

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue #1: Browser Compatibility - CRITICAL ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
```javascript
// src/services/deduplication.js
import natural from 'natural';
import levenshtein from 'fast-levenshtein';
```
The deduplication service imported Node.js-only libraries that cannot run in a browser environment, causing build failures.

**Solution:**
Implemented pure JavaScript, browser-compatible versions:
- Created custom tokenization function (replaced `natural.WordTokenizer`)
- Implemented Levenshtein distance algorithm from scratch
- Maintained identical functionality with improved portability

**Impact:**
- Build now completes successfully
- Application runs in browser without errors
- No functionality loss
- Improved code portability

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/deduplication.js`

**Verification:**
```bash
npm run build
‚úì built in 7.35s
```

---

### Issue #2: Hardcoded Paths - MODERATE ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
Shell scripts contained hardcoded absolute paths:
```bash
PROJECT_DIR="/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/app/DCS"
```
This made the scripts non-portable and would fail on different systems.

**Solution:**
Updated all shell scripts to dynamically detect their location:
```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
PROJECT_DIR="${SCRIPT_DIR}"
```

**Impact:**
- Scripts now work from any directory
- Improved portability across different systems
- Better developer experience

**Files Modified:**
- `launch.sh`
- `server.sh`
- `start-all.sh`

**Verification:**
Scripts tested successfully from repository root.

---

### Issue #3: Documentation Updates - MINOR üìù ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- README_GITHUB.md had placeholder repository URL
- No comprehensive deployment status document

**Solution:**
- Updated README_GITHUB.md with correct repository URL
- Created DEPLOYMENT_READY.md with full deployment checklist
- Verified all existing documentation accuracy

**Files Modified:**
- `README_GITHUB.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` (new)
