# Consultant Notes Priority Enhancement ‚úÖ

## Overview

Enhanced the DCS system to **explicitly prioritize consultant notes** when present, ensuring that specialty expertise from neurology, PT/OT, cardiology, infectious disease, and other consultants is properly recognized and integrated into discharge summaries.

---

## üéØ Why Consultant Notes Are Critical

### **Specialty Expertise:**
- **Neurology:** Detailed neurological deficit assessment, seizure risk, cognitive evaluation
- **PT/OT:** Gold standard for functional status, mobility, ADL independence, discharge disposition recommendations
- **Cardiology:** Cardiac risk stratification, arrhythmia management, anticoagulation guidance
- **Infectious Disease:** Antibiotic selection, duration, resistance patterns
- **Endocrinology:** Glucose management, steroid tapering, thyroid function
- **Nephrology:** Renal function, fluid management, dialysis needs
- **Pulmonology:** Ventilator weaning, oxygen requirements, respiratory status

### **Critical Information Often ONLY in Consultant Notes:**
- **Functional status details:** "Requires moderate assist for transfers", "Wheelchair level mobility"
- **Specific recommendations:** "Continue antibiotics for 6 weeks", "Follow up in neurology clinic in 2 weeks"
- **Risk assessments:** "High risk for DVT", "Seizure prophylaxis recommended for 7 days"
- **Discharge planning:** "Recommend acute rehab", "Needs home PT/OT"

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### **1. Enhanced Deduplication Priority Scoring**

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/deduplication.js`
- `src/workers/deduplicationWorker.js`

**Changes:**
- Added **consultant note detection** with 18 keyword patterns
- Assigned **+30 priority points** to consultant notes (HIGHEST priority)
- Added **+20 priority points** to attending notes
- Maintained **+15 priority points** for operative/procedure notes

**Priority Hierarchy:**
```
1. Consultant Notes: +30 points (HIGHEST)
2. Attending Notes: +20 points
3. Operative/Procedure Notes: +15 points each
4. Other factors: length, entities, temporal markers
```

**Consultant Keywords Detected:**
```javascript
const consultantKeywords = [
  'neurology consult', 'cardiology consult', 'infectious disease consult',
  'endocrine consult', 'nephrology consult', 'pulmonology consult',
  'hematology consult', 'oncology consult', 'radiation oncology',
  'physical therapy', 'occupational therapy', 'speech therapy',
  'pt consult', 'ot consult', 'st consult', 'pt/ot', 'ot/pt',
  'consultant:', 'consultation:', 'consult note', 'consult service',
  'recommendations:', 'consultant recommendations'
];
```

### **2. Enhanced LLM Extraction Prompts**

**File Modified:**
- `src/services/llmService.js`

**Changes:**

#### **Extraction Prompt Enhancement:**
Added explicit reminder:
```
‚úì CONSULTANT NOTES ARE CRITICAL: When present, consultant notes (neurology, PT/OT, 
  cardiology, etc.) provide specialty expertise and critical recommendations - 
  prioritize their findings and integrate their assessments into the clinical picture

‚úì FUNCTIONAL STATUS: Extract mobility/independence from OT/PT descriptions 
  (these are often ONLY in PT/OT consult notes)

‚úì CONSULTANT STYLES: Understand neurology (deficit-focused), PT (mobility-focused), 
  cardiology (cardiac risk), ID (antibiotic stewardship), etc.
```

#### **Summary Generation Prompt Enhancement:**
Added explicit guidance:
```
2. DEEP NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTHESIS:
   - **PRIORITIZE CONSULTANT NOTES**: When present, consultant notes (neurology, PT/OT, 
     cardiology, ID, etc.) provide critical specialty expertise - integrate their 
     findings, recommendations, and assessments prominently into the narrative
   
   - **PT/OT assessments are GOLD STANDARD for functional status** - use their specific 
     descriptions ("requires moderate assist for transfers", "wheelchair level mobility", 
     "modified independent for ADLs")
   
   - Understand consultant perspectives: Neurology (neurological deficits, seizure risk), 
     PT (mobility/transfers/gait), OT (ADL independence/cognition), Cardiology (cardiac risk), 
     ID (antibiotic selection), Endocrine (glucose management)
```

### **3. Enhanced UI Guidance**

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/BatchUpload.jsx`

**Changes:**
Added prominent tip in upload section:
```
‚Ä¢ **Include consultant notes when available** - neurology, PT/OT, cardiology, etc. 
  provide critical specialty expertise
```

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### **During Upload & Deduplication:**

1. **User uploads multiple notes** (attending, resident, consultant, PT/OT)
2. **System analyzes each note** and calculates priority score
3. **Consultant notes get +30 points** (highest priority)
4. **If duplicate/similar notes found**, system keeps the one with highest priority
5. **Result:** Consultant notes are preserved and prioritized

### **During Extraction:**

1. **LLM reads all notes** including consultant notes
2. **Explicit instructions** to prioritize consultant findings
3. **Specialty-specific extraction:**
   - PT/OT notes ‚Üí functional status, mobility, ADL independence
   - Neurology notes ‚Üí detailed neuro exam, seizure risk, cognitive status
   - Cardiology notes ‚Üí cardiac risk, arrhythmia, anticoagulation
   - ID notes ‚Üí antibiotic selection, duration, resistance
4. **Result:** Consultant expertise integrated into extracted data

### **During Summary Generation:**

1. **LLM generates narrative** with consultant findings prominently featured
2. **PT/OT assessments** used as gold standard for functional status
3. **Consultant recommendations** integrated into discharge plan
4. **Specialty perspectives** woven into clinical narrative
5. **Result:** Comprehensive summary reflecting multidisciplinary care

## üìä Impact Examples

### **Example 1: PT/OT Functional Status**

**Without Consultant Note Priority:**
```
Discharge Status: Patient ambulatory, independent.
```

**With Consultant Note Priority (PT/OT consult included):**
```
Discharge Status: Per physical therapy assessment, patient requires moderate 
assistance for transfers and is wheelchair level for mobility. Occupational 
therapy notes patient is modified independent for basic ADLs but requires 
setup for complex tasks. Recommend discharge to acute rehabilitation facility 
for continued therapy.
```

### **Example 2: Neurology Seizure Risk**

**Without Consultant Note Priority:**
```
Hospital Course: Patient underwent craniotomy. Post-operative course uneventful.
```

**With Consultant Note Priority (Neurology consult included):**
```
Hospital Course: Patient underwent craniotomy. Per neurology consultation, 
patient at high risk for post-operative seizures given cortical involvement. 
Levetiracetam 1000mg BID initiated for seizure prophylaxis, recommended for 
7 days post-operatively. Neurology to follow as outpatient.
```

### **Example 3: Cardiology Risk Assessment**

**Without Consultant Note Priority:**
```
Complications: None.
```

**With Consultant Note Priority (Cardiology consult included):**
```
Complications: Cardiology consulted for perioperative risk assessment given 
history of atrial fibrillation. Recommended continuation of anticoagulation 
with apixaban 5mg BID, holding for 48 hours perioperatively. Post-operative 
EKG showed rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. Cardiology cleared for discharge 
with outpatient follow-up in 2 weeks.
```

## üéì Key Technical Details

### **Priority Scoring Algorithm:**

```javascript
function calculateNotePriority(note, entities, temporalMarkers) {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Base factors
  score += note.length / 100;                    // Longer = more info
  score += entities.count * 10;                  // More entities = more valuable
  score += temporalMarkers.length * 5;           // More dates = more structured
  
  // CRITICAL: Consultant notes (HIGHEST)
  if (isConsultantNote(note)) {
    score += 30;  // üèÜ HIGHEST PRIORITY
  }
  
  // Attending notes (HIGH)
  if (isAttendingNote(note)) {
    score += 20;
  }
  
  // Operative/procedure notes (MEDIUM-HIGH)
  if (isOperativeNote(note)) {
    score += 15;
  }
  
  return score;
}
```

### **Consultant Note Detection:**

Uses keyword matching with 18 patterns covering:
- Explicit consult headers: "Neurology Consult", "PT Consult"
- Service mentions: "Physical Therapy", "Occupational Therapy"
- Recommendation sections: "Consultant Recommendations:", "Recommendations:"
- Abbreviations: "PT/OT", "OT/PT", "PT consult", "OT consult"

### **LLM Integration:**

Consultant note priority is reinforced at **3 levels:**
1. **Deduplication:** Consultant notes preserved
2. **Extraction:** LLM instructed to prioritize consultant findings
3. **Summary:** LLM instructed to feature consultant recommendations prominently
