## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE

### **1. LLM Provider Doesn't Matter** 🤖

| Provider | Accuracy | Quality | Speed |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Claude 3.5 | 61.9% | 70.2% | 31.1s |
| GPT-4o | 61.9% | 70.2% | 30.7s |
| Gemini Pro | 61.9% | 68.4% | 30.7s |

**Conclusion:** All three LLM providers produced **IDENTICAL extraction results**. The bottleneck is in the **extraction logic**, not the LLM capability.

**Recommendation:** Use **Gemini Pro** (most cost-effective) or **Hybrid approach** (fastest).

---

### **2. Systematic Gaps Across ALL Configurations** ⚠️

| Critical Field | Extracted | Ground Truth | Success Rate |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| MRN | ❌ 0/5 | 45678912 | **0%** |
| Surgery Date | ❌ 0/5 | 2025-09-20 | **0%** |
| Neurogenic Shock | ❌ 0/5 | POD 0-5 | **0%** |
| Late Recovery | ❌ 0/5 | POD 20 | **0%** |
| Second Washout | ❌ 0/5 | POD 16 | **0%** |
| Medications | ⚠️ 2/9 | 9 total | **22%** |

**Conclusion:** The system has **systematic blind spots** that affect all configurations equally.

---

### **3. Template Method Not Viable** 📉

| Metric | Template | LLM Average | Difference |

| Speed | 0.02s | 30.7s | **+1535x faster** |
| Dates | 0/3 | 2/3 | **-67%** |
| Procedures | 0/6* | 3/6 | **-50%** |

*Template extracted 7 items, but most were garbled/incorrect

**Conclusion:** Template method is **extremely fast but inaccurate**. Use only as fallback.

---

### **4. Hybrid Approach Best for Speed/Cost** ⚡

| Metric | Hybrid | Full LLM | Advantage |
|--------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Accuracy | 61.9% | 61.9% | **Same** |
| Quality | 64.0% | 70.2% | -6.2% |
| Speed | 13.0s | 30.7s | **58% faster** |
| Cost | $$ | $$$ | **50% cheaper** |

**Conclusion:** Hybrid approach offers **best speed/cost trade-off** with same extraction accuracy.
