  longNote: `Patient: Sarah Davis, 67F, MRN: 99887766
Admission Date: September 28, 2025

Chief Complaint: Altered mental status and severe headache

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67-year-old female with history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation on warfarin who presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe headache and altered mental status. Family reports patient was in her usual state of health until approximately 6 hours prior to presentation when she developed sudden severe headache described as "thunderclap" in nature. Shortly after headache onset, patient became confused and lethargic.

In the ED, patient was found to have GCS 13 (E3V4M6). CT head showed large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and early hydrocephalus. INR was 3.2. Patient was given vitamin K, FFP, and prothrombin complex concentrate for reversal.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension (20 years)
- Atrial fibrillation (on warfarin)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Prior stroke (2020, no residual deficits)

Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to neurosurgical ICU. Due to declining mental status and worsening hydrocephalus, patient underwent emergent right frontal craniotomy for hematoma evacuation and external ventricular drain placement on September 28, 2025.

Intraoperatively, large hematoma was evacuated. Estimated blood loss 800mL. Patient tolerated procedure well and was transferred to ICU intubated and sedated.

Post-operative Day 1: Patient remained intubated. ICP monitoring showed pressures 10-15mmHg. CT head showed good hematoma evacuation with residual edema. EVD draining well.

Post-operative Day 2: Patient extubated successfully. Following commands. GCS improved to 14 (E4V4M6). ICP remained stable.

Post-operative Day 3-5: Continued improvement. Patient more alert and oriented. Physical therapy and occupational therapy consulted. Patient able to ambulate with assistance.

Post-operative Day 6: EVD clamped for trial. Patient tolerated well without increase in ICP.

Post-operative Day 7: EVD removed. Repeat CT head showed stable ventricle size, no reaccumulation of hemorrhage.

Post-operative Day 8-12: Continued rehabilitation. Speech therapy for mild dysarthria. Patient making good progress with PT/OT.

Complications:
- Intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus (resolved with EVD)
- Mild dysarthria (improving with speech therapy)
- Urinary tract infection POD#8 (treated with ceftriaxone)

Procedures:
1. Right frontal craniotomy for hematoma evacuation (9/28/2025)
2. External ventricular drain placement (9/28/2025)
3. EVD removal (10/5/2025)

Medications on Discharge:
- Levetiracetam 1000mg PO BID (seizure prophylaxis)
- Metoprolol 50mg PO BID (blood pressure control)
- Atorvastatin 40mg PO daily
- Metformin 1000mg PO BID
- Acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h PRN pain
- Docusate 100mg PO BID (stool softener)

Discharge Date: October 10, 2025
Discharge Destination: Acute rehabilitation facility
Discharge Condition: Stable, ambulatory with assistance, mild dysarthria
Follow-up: Neurosurgery clinic in 2 weeks, Primary care in 1 week`
