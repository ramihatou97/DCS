## STEP 4: Review Generated Output

**Open the generated file:**
```bash
cat phase1-test-output.txt
```

**Or open in editor:**
```bash
code phase1-test-output.txt
```

**What to look for:**

### ‚úÖ Demographics Section (NEW)
```
Patient: Robert Chen, MRN: 45678912, Age: 67, Gender: Male
Admission: 09/20/2025, Discharge: 10/13/2025, Length of Stay: 23 days
Attending: Dr. Patterson, Service: Neurosurgery
```

### ‚úÖ Secondary Diagnoses Section (NEW)
```
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1. Neurogenic shock (resolved)
2. Bilateral pulmonary embolism (POD 10)
3. Postoperative MRSA wound infection (POD 14)
4. Urinary tract infection (POD 8, resolved)
...
```

### ‚úÖ Correct Medication Dosing
```
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
- Oxycodone 5mg PO q6h PRN pain  ‚Üê Should be q6h, NOT q4h
- Vancomycin 1g IV q12h x 4 weeks
...
```

### ‚úÖ Late Neurologic Recovery
```
DISCHARGE STATUS:
...
On POD 20, encouraging neurological recovery was observed. The patient 
demonstrated trace flicker (1/5) in the left quadriceps muscle...
```

### ‚úÖ All Complications Listed
```
COMPLICATIONS:
1. Neurogenic shock (POD 0-5) - managed with pressors
2. Urinary tract infection (POD 8) - treated with antibiotics
3. Bilateral pulmonary embolism (POD 10) - IVC filter placed
4. MRSA wound infection (POD 14) - I&D x2, vancomycin
```

---

## STEP 5: Compare to Ground Truth

**Open Gemini output (ground truth):**
```bash
# View lines 876-1036 in summaries.md
sed -n '876,1036p' summaries.md
```

**Compare:**
1. Demographics completeness
2. Secondary diagnoses coverage
3. Medication accuracy
4. Functional status detail
5. Complication completeness

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Test Script Fails to Load Notes

**Error:**
```
Error: Could not find end of clinical notes in summaries.md
```

**Solution:**
- Verify `summaries.md` exists in project root
- Check file contains "# Summary 1: DCS App" marker
- Ensure file is not corrupted

### Issue: Summary Generation Fails

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Summary generation failed: [error message]
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Backend not running:**
   ```bash
   cd backend && node server.js
   ```

2. **API key missing:**
   - Check `backend/.env` has API keys
   - Verify at least one provider configured

3. **Timeout:**
   - Increase timeout in test script
   - Check network connection

### Issue: Low Accuracy (<70%)

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Phase 1 changes not applied correctly**
   - Review `PHASE1_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`
   - Verify all 4 changes in `llmService.js`
   - Run `npm run build` again

2. **LLM not following prompt**
   - Try different provider (Claude vs GPT-4o vs Gemini)
   - Check prompt in `llmService.js` lines 822-929

3. **Note truncation still too aggressive**
   - Verify truncation limit is 30000 (line 817)
   - Consider removing truncation entirely

### Issue: Specific Fields Missing

**Demographics missing:**
- Check prompt has section 0 (Patient Demographics)
- Verify `summarizeExtractedData` includes name, MRN, etc.

**Late recovery missing:**
- Check truncation limit (should be 30000)
- Verify prompt emphasizes "late neurologic recovery"
- Check neuro_exam in `summarizeExtractedData`

**Medications wrong:**
- Check prompt has "MEDICATION ACCURACY" section
- Verify "copy verbatim" instruction present

---

## NEXT STEPS

### If Phase 1 Successful (‚â•70% accuracy)

1. **Document results:**
   - Save test output
   - Note accuracy scores
   - Capture any issues

2. **Test additional cases:**
   ```bash
   # Test with SAH case
   # Modify test script to use docs/sample-note-SAH.txt
   ```

3. **Proceed to Phase 2:**
   - Review `DCS_ACCURACY_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` Phase 2 section
   - Begin single-pass architecture implementation

### If Phase 1 Unsuccessful (<70% accuracy)

1. **Review output:**
   - Identify which categories are low
   - Check for specific missing elements

2. **Refine prompts:**
   - Add more emphasis to weak areas
   - Provide more examples

3. **Debug:**
   - Check console logs
   - Verify LLM provider is working
   - Test with different provider

4. **Re-test:**
   ```bash
   node test-phase1-improvements.js
   ```
