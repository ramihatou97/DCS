## üêõ Troubleshooting Failed Tests

### **If Step 1 Tests Fail (Negation Detection)**

**Symptom:** Vasospasm or headache extracted despite negation

**Possible Causes:**
1. Negation detection not integrated properly
2. `validateComplicationExtraction()` not being called
3. Negation patterns not matching

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check console logs for negation filtering messages
2. Verify `src/services/extraction.js` has negation integration
3. Review `PHASE1_STEP1_NEGATION_INTEGRATION.md`

---

### **If Step 2 Tests Fail (Temporal Qualifiers)**

**Symptom:** `temporalContext` field missing or empty

**Possible Causes:**
1. Temporal qualifiers not integrated properly
2. `extractTemporalQualifier()` not being called
3. Data structure not enhanced

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check if `temporalContext` field exists in dates
2. Verify `src/services/extraction.js` has temporal integration
3. Review `PHASE1_STEP2_TEMPORAL_INTEGRATION.md`

---

### **If Step 3 Tests Fail (Source Quality)**

**Symptom:** Quality metadata missing or confidence not calibrated

**Possible Causes:**
1. Source quality assessment not integrated
2. `assessSourceQuality()` or `calibrateConfidence()` not being called
3. Metadata not included in results

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check console logs for quality assessment messages
2. Verify `metadata.sourceQuality` exists
3. Review `PHASE1_STEP3_SOURCE_QUALITY_INTEGRATION.md`

---

### **If Step 4 Tests Fail (Regression)**

**Symptom:** Basic extraction not working (demographics, dates, pathology)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Integration broke existing functionality
2. Data structure changes incompatible
3. Extraction logic modified incorrectly

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check console for extraction errors
2. Verify basic extraction still works
3. Review recent code changes for breaking changes

---

### **If Step 5 Tests Fail (Integration)**

**Symptom:** Console errors or enhancements not all active

**Possible Causes:**
1. JavaScript errors in integration code
2. Import statements incorrect
3. Try-catch blocks catching and hiding errors

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check browser console for red error messages
2. Verify all imports are correct
3. Check if any enhancement is silently failing
