### My Output (One-Shot Generation):

```
DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Patient: 62-year-old male
Admission Date: October 10, 2024
Discharge Date: October 20, 2024

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), Hunt-Hess grade 3,
Modified Fisher scale 3, secondary to ruptured 7mm anterior
communicating artery aneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient presented with sudden onset severe headache, nausea,
vomiting, and brief loss of consciousness. CT head demonstrated
diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with 7mm AcomA aneurysm on CTA.
He was admitted to the Neuro ICU and aspirin was held. An external
ventricular drain was placed on HD#1 for acute hydrocephalus with
opening pressure of 25 cm H2O.

On HD#2, the patient underwent cerebral angiogram with successful
coiling of the aneurysm by Dr. Smith with complete occlusion
achieved. His post-procedural course was complicated by vasospasm
on HD#5, managed with induced hypertension and nimodipine. TCD
showed elevated velocities in bilateral MCAs (peak 180 cm/s) that
improved with treatment. The EVD was successfully weaned over 3 days
and removed on HD#8. Follow-up CT demonstrated resolving hemorrhage
without new infarcts.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Patient is ambulating independently with mRS 2 and KPS 80. He is
discharged home in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Nimodipine 60mg PO q4h for 11 more days
2. Levetiracetam 500mg PO BID for 3 months
3. Acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h PRN
4. Docusate 100mg PO BID

FOLLOW-UP:
- Neurosurgery clinic in 2 weeks
- Cerebral angiogram in 6 months
- CT head in 4 weeks
- Activity restrictions and warning signs discussed
```

### Characteristics:
- ✅ Grammatically perfect

**User Can:**
- Click any field to edit
- Correct wrong extractions
- Add missing information
- See confidence warnings
- Review timeline chronologically

### Step 3: **ML LEARNING FROM CORRECTIONS**

If user corrects "AcomA" to "anterior communicating artery":

```javascript
// ML Learning System Stores:
{
  correction: {
    field: 'pathology.location',
    originalValue: 'AcomA',
    correctedValue: 'anterior communicating artery',
    sourceText: '...7mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm...',
    pattern: /anterior communicating artery/gi,
    frequency: 1,
    pathology: 'aSAH'
  }
}

// Next time the app sees "anterior communicating artery":
// - Higher confidence for full name
// - Learns abbreviation mapping
// - Improves future extractions
```

### Step 4: **TEMPLATE-BASED GENERATION**

The app uses **specialized templates** for different pathologies:

```javascript
// SAH-specific template includes:
- Hunt-Hess and Fisher grading (required)
- Aneurysm location and size
- EVD management
- Vasospasm monitoring
- TCD velocities
- Nimodipine protocol
- Angiographic follow-up plan

// vs. Tumor template would include:
- WHO grade
- Extent of resection
- IDH/MGMT status
- Radiation/chemo plan
```

### Step 5: **GENERATED DISCHARGE SUMMARY**

```
DISCHARGE SUMMARY

PATIENT INFORMATION:
62-year-old male

---

## 🔬 SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:

### Example 1: Date Inconsistency

**Claude Direct:**
- Might say "HD#5" without calculating the actual date
- No validation that HD#5 = October 15

**DCS App:**
- Extracts admission date: Oct 10
- Calculates HD#5 = Oct 15
- Validates: ✅ Correct
- Flags if inconsistent: ⚠️ "HD#5 should be Oct 15, but note says Oct 16"

### Example 2: Missing Critical Data

**Claude Direct:**
- Might miss that EVD opening pressure was 25 cm H2O
- No warning about missing data

**DCS App:**
- Extracts: `icuStay.evd.openingPressure: 25`
- Confidence: 90%
- If missing: ⚠️ "EVD details incomplete - consider adding opening pressure"

### Example 3: User Corrections

**Scenario:** Surgeon prefers "anterior communicating artery" spelled out, not "AcomA"

**Claude Direct:**
- User must manually edit text
- No learning for next time
- Must remember preference

**DCS App:**
1. User edits: "AcomA" → "anterior communicating artery"
2. ML system learns: `abbreviation_preference: full_name`
3. Next case: Automatically uses full name
4. Confidence increases: 90% → 95%

### Example 4: Multiple Revisions

**Scenario:** Attending wants to add more details about vasospasm management

**Claude Direct:**
- Must regenerate entire summary
- Previous edits lost
- Start from scratch

**DCS App:**
1. User edits `complications.vasospasm.management`
2. Adds: "...managed with induced MAP 110-130 mmHg..."
3. Click "Regenerate Summary"
4. Only that section updates
5. All other extractions preserved
