### **3. Enhanced LLM Service** ‚úÖ ENHANCED
**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`

**Enhancements:**

#### **A. Knowledge-Enhanced Extraction Prompts**
- Builds context before extraction
- Adds pathology-specific guidance to prompts
- Includes grading scale ranges in prompts
- Emphasizes consultant notes with focus areas
- Adds clinical reasoning clues to prompts

**Example Enhancement:**
```
üéØ PATHOLOGY CONTEXT: SAH
Expected critical fields: gradingScales.huntHess, gradingScales.fisher, aneurysm.location

GRADING SCALES:
- Hunt and Hess Grade: Range 1-5
- Fisher Grade: Range 1-4

üë• CONSULTANT NOTES PRESENT (2):
- PTOT: Focus on functional status, mobility, ADL independence
- NEUROLOGY: Focus on neurological deficits, seizure risk, cognitive status
‚ö†Ô∏è PT/OT notes are GOLD STANDARD for functional status - prioritize their assessments!

üîç CLINICAL REASONING CLUES:
- Nimodipine mentioned ‚Üí SAH with vasospasm risk
  Expected: Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher grade, aneurysm location
```

#### **B. Knowledge-Based Validation**
- Validates extracted data against knowledge base after extraction
- Attaches validation errors to result (`_validationErrors`)
- Attaches validation warnings to result (`_validationWarnings`)
- Suggests missing critical fields (`_suggestions`)

**Example Validation:**
```javascript
// GCS validation
if (gcs < 3 || gcs > 15) {
  errors.push({
    field: 'examination.gcs.total',
    value: gcs,
    message: `GCS must be between 3 and 15 (got ${gcs})`,
    severity: 'error'
  });
}
```

#### **C. Knowledge-Enhanced Summary Generation**
- Builds context for summary generation
- Retrieves red flags from knowledge base
- Retrieves follow-up protocols from knowledge base
- Adds red flags to discharge instructions
- Adds follow-up protocols to summary
- Integrates consultant expertise into narrative

**Example Enhancement:**
```
üö® RED FLAGS TO INCLUDE IN DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
- New or worsening headache uncontrolled by medications
- Seizure (new or recurrent)
- Neurological change (new weakness, numbness, vision change)
- Sudden severe headache (SAH-specific)

üìÖ FOLLOW-UP PROTOCOL FOR SAH:
Clinic visits: 2 weeks (wound check), 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year
Imaging: CTA/MRA at 6 months, 1 year, then Q3-5 years

üë• CONSULTANT EXPERTISE AVAILABLE:
- PTOT: Integrate their functional status, mobility, ADL independence assessments
- NEUROLOGY: Integrate their neurological deficits, seizure risk assessments
```

**Impact:**
- Extraction prompts are more targeted and context-aware
- Extracted data is validated against clinical knowledge
- Summaries include critical safety information (red flags)
- Summaries include structured follow-up protocols
- Consultant expertise is properly emphasized

### **4. Enhanced Extraction Service** ‚úÖ ENHANCED
**File:** `src/services/extraction.js`

**Enhancements:**

- Logs context information (pathology, consultants, complexity)
- Passes context to pattern extraction

#### **B. Learned Pattern Loading**
- Automatically loads learned patterns from IndexedDB
- Filters patterns by pathology when context available
- Logs pattern application statistics
- Applies patterns with confidence weighting

**Example:**
```javascript
// Load learned patterns from database
await learningEngine.initialize();
const allPatterns = await tx.store.getAll();
const enabledPatterns = allPatterns.filter(p => p.enabled !== false);
console.log(`üìö Loaded ${enabledPatterns.length} learned patterns from database`);

// Filter by pathology
const pathologySpecificPatterns = learnedPatterns.filter(p => 
  !p.pathology || p.pathology === context.pathology.primary
);
console.log(`  ‚Üí ${pathologySpecificPatterns.length} patterns match pathology ${context.pathology.primary}`);
```

#### **C. Context-Aware Pattern Extraction**
- Pattern extraction receives context
- Patterns filtered by detected pathology
- Consultant weights applied to relevant fields
- Temporal validation applied

**Impact:**
- Learned patterns are now actively applied during extraction
- Patterns are filtered by pathology for better accuracy
- Context improves pattern matching and field extraction
- System learns and improves over time
