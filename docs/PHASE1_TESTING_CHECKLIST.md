## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Negation Detection Fails
1. Check console for negation detection logs
2. Verify `validateComplicationExtraction()` is being called
3. Check if complications are being extracted at all
4. Review `PHASE1_STEP1_NEGATION_INTEGRATION.md` for debugging

### If Temporal Qualifiers Fail
1. Check if `temporalContext` field exists in dates
2. Verify `extractTemporalQualifier()` is being called
3. Check console for temporal extraction errors
4. Review `PHASE1_STEP2_TEMPORAL_INTEGRATION.md` for debugging

### If Source Quality Fails
1. Check console for quality assessment logs
2. Verify `assessSourceQuality()` is being called
3. Check if `metadata.sourceQuality` exists
4. Review `PHASE1_STEP3_SOURCE_QUALITY_INTEGRATION.md` for debugging

### If Regression Tests Fail
1. Check console for extraction errors
2. Verify basic extraction still works
3. Check if any existing functionality broke
4. Review recent code changes

## üìù Additional Test Cases (Optional)

### Test Case A: Poor Quality Note
Test source quality with a low-quality note:

```
pt came in with headache
had sah
did coiling
went home
```

**Expected:**
- Quality Grade: POOR or VERY_POOR
- Confidence scores significantly reduced

### Test Case B: Negation Edge Cases
Test negation detection with edge cases:

```
Patient developed vasospasm but no neurological deficits.
History of prior stroke, no evidence of new stroke.
Fever resolved, no longer febrile.
```

**Expected:**
- "vasospasm" extracted (not negated)
- "neurological deficits" filtered (negated)
- "stroke" filtered (negated - "no evidence of new stroke")
- "fever" extracted (mentioned as resolved, but was present)
