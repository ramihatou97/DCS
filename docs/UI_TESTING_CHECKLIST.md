### **Test 3: Multiple Pathologies** üß†

**Paste this note:**
```
Patient: Mary Johnson, 62F

## üìä **QUALITY METRICS INTERPRETATION**

### **Overall Quality Score:**
- **90-100%:** Excellent - All fields present, high confidence
- **80-89%:** Good - Most fields present, good confidence
- **70-79%:** Fair - Some missing fields, acceptable confidence
- **<70%:** Poor - Many missing fields, low confidence

### **Extraction Quality:**
- **Completeness:** % of expected fields extracted
- **Confidence:** Average confidence across all extractions
- **Missing Fields:** List of critical missing data

### **Summary Quality:**
- **Readability:** Flesch Reading Ease score (60-70 = standard)
- **Completeness:** % of sections with content
- **Coherence:** Logical flow and transitions
- **Word Count:** Length of generated summary

---

## üêõ **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue: Quality Dashboard not visible**
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify extraction completed successfully
3. Refresh page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)

### **Issue: Relationships showing 0**
**Solution:**
- This is expected for simple notes
- Relationships require explicit causal language
- Try Test 2 (Complex SAH) for better results

### **Issue: Quality score seems low**
**Solution:**
- Check if note has all required fields
- Simple notes naturally score lower
- Add more details (grades, scores, dates) to improve

### **Issue: Medical writing style not applied**
**Solution:**
- Check if using LLM generation (not template)
- Verify LLM provider is configured
- Check console for style application logs
