# Discharge Summary Generator - Clinical Objectives & Constraints

## üéØ Primary Mission

Create **accurate, chronologically coherent medical narratives** that capture the patient's complete journey from admission to discharge, synthesizing unstructured, repetitive, variable-style clinical notes into comprehensive neurosurgical discharge summaries.

## üìã Input Note Types

| Note Type | Content Focus | Contains | Priority |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Admission Notes** | Initial presentation, history, physical exam | Demographics, presentation, initial workup | HIGH |
| **Progress Notes** | Daily clinical status, events | **Often contains procedure details** | HIGH |
| **Operative Notes** | Surgical procedure details | Procedure specifics (when separate) | HIGH |
| **Procedure Notes** | Intervention specifics | Procedure details (when separate) | HIGH |
| **Consultant Notes** | Specialist recommendations | Thrombosis, ID, Neurology, Palliative input | MEDIUM |
| **PT/OT Notes** | Functional assessment | **ONLY source for functional scores** | HIGH |
| **Medication List** | Drug regimen | Provided separately | LOW |

**Key Note:** Procedure information is frequently embedded in progress notes rather than separate operative/procedure notes.

**Combined assessment** of:
- Mobility
- Self-care ability
- Cognitive function
- Assistance level required
- Activity limitations

## üö´ Critical Constraints

### ‚ùå NEVER Extrapolate or Recommend

**The application must NEVER:**
- Generate medical recommendations
- Suggest treatment plans
- Extrapolate beyond documented facts
- Make clinical assumptions
- Propose diagnostic or therapeutic interventions

**Exception:** Functional status scores (KPS, ECOG, mRS) can be calculated from PT/OT notes and clinical exams.

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS Document Source

**Every extracted field must have:**
- Clear source in clinical notes
- Direct documentation (not inferred)
- Verifiable text match

**If not documented ‚Üí Do not extract**

3. **Consultant note parsing** (service-specific formats)
4. **Complication identification** (neurosurgical complications)
5. **Discharge destination classification** (various facilities/outcomes)
6. **Functional status indicators** (PT/OT terminology)
7. **Timeline reconstruction** (chronological ordering)
8. **Pathology-specific patterns** (per user corrections)

**Learning from:**
- User corrections of extracted data
- Imported discharge summaries (with or without source notes)
- Pathology-specific templates
- Institution-specific terminology

**Privacy:**
- 100% local learning
- Complete PHI removal before pattern storage
- HIPAA-compliant anonymization
