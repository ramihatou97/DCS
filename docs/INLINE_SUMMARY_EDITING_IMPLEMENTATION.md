## 🧠 Learning System Details

### **Correction Types Tracked:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `style_change` | Changed writing style | Verbose → Concise |
| `terminology` | Changed medical terms | "aSAH" → "aneurysmal SAH" |
| `detail_added` | Added more detail | Added specific dates/times |
| `detail_removed` | Removed unnecessary detail | Removed redundant info |
| `structure_change` | Reordered/restructured | Changed sentence order |
| `abbreviation` | Changed abbreviation usage | Expanded or abbreviated terms |
| `transition_added` | Added transition phrases | Added "Subsequently," |

### **Learning Strategies:**

1. **Style Preferences** (≥2 corrections)
   - Detects if user prefers concise (length ratio < 0.8) or detailed (ratio > 1.2)
   - Confidence increases with more examples

2. **Terminology Preferences** (≥2 corrections)
   - Tracks abbreviation expansion vs usage
   - Learns which terms to expand vs abbreviate

3. **Structure Preferences** (≥1 correction)
   - Analyzes sentence count changes
   - Learns preference for shorter vs longer sentences

4. **Transition Phrases** (≥2 corrections)
   - Tracks added transition phrases
   - Learns which transitions user prefers

5. **Detail Level** (≥2 corrections)
   - Tracks date/time additions
   - Tracks laterality (left/right) additions
   - Tracks specificity increases

### **Pattern Application:**

Learned patterns are applied in two ways:

1. **LLM Prompt Enhancement:**
   - Learned preferences added to system prompt
   - Example: "Use concise, direct language (avoid verbose phrasing)"
   - Example: "Spell out medical abbreviations on first use"

2. **Post-Processing:**
   - Apply patterns to LLM-generated text
   - Style adjustments (concise vs detailed)
   - Terminology adjustments (abbreviations)
   - Transition phrase additions
