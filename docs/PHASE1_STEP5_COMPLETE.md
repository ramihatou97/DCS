# Phase 1 Step 5 Implementation Complete

## Summary
Multi-Value Extraction with Temporal Context and Semantic Deduplication has been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Temporal Context Detection (`src/utils/temporalExtraction.js`)
**Purpose**: Distinguish between references to past events and new events

**Key Features**:
- Detects reference phrases: "s/p", "status post", "POD#X"
- Identifies new event indicators: "underwent", "taken to OR", "today"
- Extracts POD (Post-Operative Day) context
- Resolves relative dates (POD#3 â†’ actual date)
- Links reference mentions to actual events

**Example**:
```
Input: "Patient underwent coiling on 10/1. POD#3, s/p coiling, doing well."
Detection: 1 new event (coiling on 10/1) + 2 references
Output: Single procedure with references, not 3 duplicate procedures
```

### 2. Semantic Deduplication (`src/utils/semanticDeduplication.js`)
**Purpose**: Merge similar medical entities with different names

**Key Features**:
- Medical synonym dictionaries (procedures, medications, complications)
- Multi-algorithm similarity scoring:
  - Jaccard similarity (40%)
  - Levenshtein distance (20%)
  - Semantic similarity (40%)
- Threshold-based clustering (0.75 default)
- Canonical name mapping

**Examples**:
- "coiling" = "endovascular coiling" = "coil embolization" â†’ "aneurysm coiling"
- "clipping" = "surgical clipping" = "microsurgical clipping" â†’ "aneurysm clipping"
- "aspirin" = "ASA" = "acetylsalicylic acid" â†’ "aspirin"

### 3. Enhanced Extraction Functions (`src/services/extraction.js`)

#### **extractProcedures()** (lines 998-1226)
7-step temporal pipeline:
1. Extract all procedure mentions with temporal context
2. Separate references from new events
3. Apply semantic deduplication to new events
4. Link references to actual procedure events
5. Combine deduplicated events with unlinked references
6. Clean up and normalize
7. Sort chronologically

#### **extractComplications()** (lines 1229-1500)
- Tracks onset dates for complications
- Uses temporal context detection
- Applies semantic deduplication
- Preserves severity and resolution information

#### **extractMedications()** (lines 1769-2059)
- Timeline tracking (started/stopped/changed)
- Status detection:
  - "started", "began", "initiated" â†’ status: started
  - "discontinued", "stopped", "D/C" â†’ status: discontinued
  - "continued", "maintained" â†’ status: continued
  - "increased", "decreased", "adjusted" â†’ status: changed
- Start/stop date extraction
- Semantic deduplication for medication synonyms

#### **extractWithPatterns()** (lines 361-438)
- Builds referenceDates object from extracted dates
- Passes reference dates to all extraction functions
- Enables POD resolution and temporal intelligence

## Technical Implementation Details

### Date Handling
- **Issue Fixed**: Timezone problems with `new Date()` parsing
- **Solution**: Use `parseFlexibleDate()` from dateUtils.js for consistent parsing
- **POD Resolution**:
  - Priority: firstProcedure > admission > ictus > surgeryDates array
  - Correctly adds days to reference date

### Reference Linking Algorithm
```javascript
for each reference:
  find best matching event using similarity function
  attach reference to event's references array

return:
  linked: events with attached references
  unlinked: references that couldn't be matched
```

### Deduplication Stats Tracking
```javascript
getDeduplicationStats() returns:
  - inputCount: original entity count
  - outputCount: deduplicated count
  - reductionPercent: percentage reduction
  - clusters: number of semantic groups
```
