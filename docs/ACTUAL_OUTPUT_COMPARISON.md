DISCHARGE SUMMARY

PATIENT: 62-year-old male

ADMISSION DATE: October 10, 2024
DISCHARGE DATE: October 20, 2024

DIAGNOSIS:
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), Hunt-Hess grade 3,
Modified Fisher scale 3, secondary to 7mm anterior communicating
artery aneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient presented to the emergency department on October 10, 2024
with sudden onset severe headache described as "worst headache of life."
Associated symptoms included nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck
stiffness with one episode of loss of consciousness. CT head demonstrated
diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and sylvian fissures
bilaterally. CT angiography revealed a 7mm anterior communicating artery
aneurysm.

Patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical ICU. Aspirin was held on
admission. External ventricular drain was placed on October 11, 2024
for management of acute hydrocephalus with opening pressure of 25 cm H2O.

On October 12, 2024, the patient underwent cerebral angiogram with
endovascular coiling of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm
performed by Dr. Smith. Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved
without complications.

The post-procedural course was complicated by vasospasm on hospital
day 5 (October 15, 2024), which was managed with induced hypertension
and nimodipine 60mg every 4 hours. Transcranial Dopplers demonstrated
elevated velocities in bilateral middle cerebral arteries with peak
velocities of 180 cm/s that improved with treatment.

The external ventricular drain was successfully weaned over 3 days
and removed on October 18, 2024. Follow-up CT head showed resolving
hemorrhage without new infarcts.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Patient is ambulating independently with physical therapy. Modified
Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 at discharge. Karnofsky Performance
Status (KPS) of 80.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Nimodipine 60mg PO every 4 hours for 21 days total (11 days remaining)
2. Levetiracetam 500mg PO twice daily for seizure prophylaxis × 3 months
3. Acetaminophen 650mg PO every 6 hours as needed for headache
4. Docusate 100mg PO twice daily for constipation

FOLLOW-UP:
- Neurosurgery clinic in 2 weeks for wound check and clinical assessment
- Repeat cerebral angiogram in 6 months to assess aneurysm occlusion
- Follow-up CT head in 4 weeks
- Gradual return to normal activities as tolerated
- No driving until cleared by neurosurgeon
- Warning signs reviewed with patient and family

Patient and family educated regarding discharge instructions and
verbalized understanding.

# 💡 THE REAL-WORLD DIFFERENCE

## Scenario: Attending Physician Review

### With Claude Direct Output:
```
Attending: "This is too brief. I need:
- TCD velocities documented
- Specific MAP targets used
- Why did we do a 6-month angiogram?
- Medication purposes aren't clear
- Warning signs need to be explicit"

→ Must regenerate entire summary
→ Hope it includes missing details
→ May need multiple attempts
```

### With DCS App Output:
```
Attending: [Reviews summary]
"Good, but let's add the Lindegaard ratio."

→ User clicks Edit → TCD section
→ Adds "Lindegaard ratio: 4.2"
→ Clicks Regenerate → Only TCD section updates
→ Done in 30 seconds
```

# 🏆 BOTTOM LINE

## Claude Direct = **Quick Draft**
- Good for: Initial summaries, general overview
- Problem: Lacks structure, detail, and editability
- **Use case:** Private notes, informal documentation

## DCS App = **Complete Medical Record**
- Good for: Official discharge summaries, legal medical records
- Benefits: Comprehensive, structured, validated, editable
- **Use case:** Hospital discharge, medical-legal documentation, quality metrics

---

**The app doesn't just generate text faster - it generates BETTER, more COMPLETE, more USEFUL medical documentation that meets institutional and legal standards.**
