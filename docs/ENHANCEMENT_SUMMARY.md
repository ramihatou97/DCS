## 📞 Questions to Consider

Before proceeding with implementation:

1. **Priority Confirmation:** Do you agree with the priority rankings? Any changes needed?

2. **Timeline:** Is the 6-week implementation timeline acceptable? Need to accelerate or adjust?

3. **Resources:** Do you have development resources available for implementation?

4. **Testing:** Do you have test clinical notes available for validation?

5. **Metrics:** Are the success metrics appropriate? Any additional metrics to track?

6. **Phasing:** Should we implement all of Phase 1 at once, or incrementally?
