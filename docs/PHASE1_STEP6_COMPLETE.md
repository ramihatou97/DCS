# Phase 1 Step 6 Implementation Complete

## Summary
Pathology Subtypes Detection with Clinical Intelligence has been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Pathology Subtype Detection Utility (`src/utils/pathologySubtypes.js`)
**Purpose**: Extract detailed pathology subtypes with risk stratification, prognosis predictions, and treatment recommendations

**Key Components**:

#### **Aneurysm Classification (SAH)**
- **Location Detection**: 6 major locations
  - Anterior Communicating Artery (AComm)
  - Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)
  - Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm)
  - Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)
  - Basilar Artery
  - Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)
- **Size Categories**: Small (<7mm), Large (7-25mm), Giant (>25mm)
- **Hunt & Hess Prognosis**: Mortality and good outcome predictions
- **Fisher Grade Vasospasm Risk**: Percentage risk calculation (5-10% for Grade 1, 60-70% for Grade 3)

#### **Tumor Classification**
- **WHO Grades**: I-IV with specific prognosis and treatment protocols
- **Molecular Markers Detection**:
  - IDH mutation status (+75% survival if mutant)
  - MGMT promoter methylation (+35% survival if methylated)
  - 1p/19q codeletion (favorable prognosis marker)
- **Resection Extent**: GTR, NTR, STR, Biopsy
- **Personalized GBM Survival Calculation**:
  - Baseline: 15 months
  - Adjusted for IDH, MGMT, resection extent, age
  - Example: IDH-mutant + MGMT-methylated + GTR + Age<50 = 51 months

#### **Spine Injury Classification**
- **ASIA Impairment Scale**: A (Complete) through E (Normal)
- **Functional Prognosis**:
  - ASIA A: <5% chance of recovery
  - ASIA D: >80% achieve motor recovery
- **Injury Level**: Cervical, Thoracic, Lumbar
- **Ambulation Prediction**

#### **Treatment Recommendations by Pathology Type**

**SAH Protocols**:
- Daily TCD for 14 days
- Nimodipine 60mg q4h x 21 days (MANDATORY)
- Neuro checks q1h x 48h
- Monitor for DCI POD 4-14

**Tumor Protocols**:
- MRI brain with contrast 24-48h postop
- MRI every 2-3 months during treatment
- Dexamethasone taper over 2-4 weeks
- Levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis

**Spine Protocols**:
- Plain films/CT at 6 weeks, 3mo, 6mo, 1yr
- Physical therapy starting POD 1-2
- DVT prophylaxis
- Bone health optimization

#### **Complication Risk Stratification**

**SAH Complications**:
- Vasospasm/DCI: Moderate-High risk, POD 4-14
- Hydrocephalus: Moderate risk, Acute or delayed
- Rebleed: High risk (if untreated), First 24-48h

**Tumor Complications**:
- Seizures: Moderate-High risk
- Recurrence: Very High for WHO IV
- Radiation necrosis: Low risk, 6-24 months post-RT

**Spine Complications**:
- Hardware failure: Low risk
- Pseudoarthrosis: Moderate risk
- CSF leak: Low-Moderate risk

### 2. Prognostic Calculation Functions

#### **calculateHuntHessPrognosis(grade)**
Maps Hunt & Hess grades (1-5) to outcomes:
- Grade 1: 5-10% mortality, 85-90% good outcome, LOW risk
- Grade 3: 15-20% mortality, 60-70% good outcome, MODERATE risk
- Grade 5: 60-70% mortality, 10-20% good outcome, VERY HIGH risk

#### **calculateVasospasmRisk(fisherGrade)**
Maps Fisher grades to vasospasm percentage:
- Grade 1: 5-10%, LOW risk
- Grade 3: 60-70%, HIGH risk
- Grade 4: 30-40%, MODERATE risk

#### **calculateGBMPrognosis(factors)**
Multi-factorial survival calculation:
```javascript
Baseline: 15 months
+ IDH-mutant: ×1.75
+ MGMT-methylated: ×1.35
+ GTR: ×1.25
+ Age <50: +15%
+ Age >70: -25%
```

**Example**:
- Worst case (STR, age 75): 12 months
- Best case (IDH-mutant, MGMT-methylated, GTR, age 45): 51 months
- Average case (MGMT-methylated, STR): 22 months

### 3. Integration with Extraction Pipeline (`src/services/extraction.js`)

**Enhanced extractPathology() function** (lines 848-1010):
1. Added `subtype: null` field to data object
2. Loops through detected pathology types
3. Calls `detectPathologySubtype()` for each
4. Uses first detailed subtype found
5. Increases confidence to HIGH if subtype with prognosis detected
6. Comprehensive console logging for debugging

**Key Changes**:
- Line 56-57: Import statement added
- Line 859: Added subtype field
- Lines 971-1007: Subtype detection logic

### 4. Bug Fixes During Testing

**Issue 1**: Fisher grade field name mismatch
- **Problem**: Code checked `extractedData.grades?.fisher` but tests passed `modifiedFisher`
- **Fix**: Check both field names using `||` operator (line 556)
- **File**: `src/utils/pathologySubtypes.js:556`

**Issue 2**: GBM prognosis not calculating personalized survival
- **Problem 1**: Age not extracted from text
- **Problem 2**: Updating wrong field (`medianSurvival` instead of `survival`)
- **Fix**:
  - Added age extraction with regex `/\b(?:age|Age)\s+(\d+)/i`
  - Updated `prognosis.survival` field instead of creating new field
- **File**: `src/utils/pathologySubtypes.js:627-644`
