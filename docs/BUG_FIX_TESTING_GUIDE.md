- ‚úÖ Primary pathology: `'general'`
- ‚úÖ Application processes note without errors
- ‚úÖ Basic demographics and dates extracted

---

### Test 4: Complex Spine Case

**Objective:** Verify spine pathology detection and processing

**Test Data:**
```
Patient: Mary Williams, 58F
Admission Date: October 5, 2025

History: Progressive myelopathy. MRI showed L4-L5 stenosis with cord compression.

Procedure: L4-L5 laminectomy and fusion performed October 6, 2025.
Instrumentation: Pedicle screws L4-L5.

Neurological Status:
- Preop: 4/5 lower extremity strength, hyperreflexia
- Postop: Improved to 4+/5 strength

Course: Ambulating with PT. Pain controlled.

Discharge: October 10, 2025 to home with spine surgery follow-up in 2 weeks.
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Console shows: `üîç Detected pathologies: ['SPINE']`
- ‚úÖ Extracted data includes spine level, approach, instrumentation
- ‚úÖ Neurological status captured
- ‚úÖ No errors

---

### Test 5: Batch Upload (Multiple Notes)

**Objective:** Verify application handles multiple notes in batch

**Steps:**
1. Upload 3-5 different clinical notes
2. Click "Process Notes" button
3. Observe processing of each note

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All notes processed without freezing
- ‚úÖ Each note shows detected pathology in console
- ‚úÖ Extracted data for each note
- ‚úÖ No errors

---

## üîç Console Monitoring

### Expected Console Output (Success)

```
üîç Detected pathologies: ['SAH']
üß† Context built for extraction: {
  pathology: 'SAH',
  consultants: { count: 0, ... },
  complexity: 'moderate'
}
Extraction method: LLM-enhanced
Attempting LLM extraction...
Running pattern extraction for data enrichment...
üìö Applying 0 learned patterns to extraction
LLM extraction successful with pattern enrichment
```

### Warning Messages (Acceptable)

These warnings indicate the defensive programming is working:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è getGradingScales received object instead of string: { type: 'SAH', ... }
```

If you see this warning, it means:
- The defensive programming caught an object input
- The function extracted the `type` property correctly
- Processing continued without crashing

**Action:** This is acceptable but indicates upstream code could be improved to pass strings directly.

### Error Messages (Failure)

These errors indicate the bug is NOT fixed:

```
‚ùå Failed to process notes: pathology?.toUpperCase is not a function
TypeError: pathology?.toUpperCase is not a function
```

**Action:** If you see this error, the bug fix did not work. Report immediately.

## üêõ Debugging Failed Tests

### If Application Still Freezes

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for error messages
   - Note the exact error and stack trace
   - Take a screenshot

2. **Check Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Ensure build is successful
   - Check for any warnings

3. **Clear Cache:**
   - Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart application

4. **Check File Changes:**
   - Verify all changes were saved
   - Check git status: `git status`
   - Review diffs: `git diff`

---

### If Extraction is Incorrect

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Look for `üîç Detected pathologies:` message
   - Verify pathology types are strings, not objects
   - Check context building messages

2. **Verify Test Data:**
   - Ensure test note contains clear pathology indicators
   - Check for typos in medical terms

3. **Check Confidence Scores:**
   - Low confidence may indicate pattern matching issues
   - Review extraction patterns in `pathologyPatterns.js`
