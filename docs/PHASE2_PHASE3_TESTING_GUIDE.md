```
Patient: John Doe, 55M
Admission Date: October 10, 2025

Chief Complaint: Sudden severe headache

History: Patient presented with sudden onset severe headache. 
CT head showed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hunt and Hess grade 3.
CTA revealed left MCA aneurysm.

Procedure: Left craniotomy for aneurysm clipping performed on October 11, 2025.

Course: Patient tolerated procedure well. No vasospasm. 
Started on nimodipine. Neurologically stable.

Discharge: October 15, 2025 to home with neurosurgery follow-up.
```

3. Click **"Process Notes"**

#### **Step 4: Verify Phase 2 Enhancements**

Look for **"Clinical Intelligence"** panel showing:
- ‚úÖ Timeline events
- ‚úÖ Treatment responses
- ‚úÖ Functional evolution
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Relationships (Phase 2 Step 4)

#### **Step 5: Verify Phase 3 Enhancements**

Look for **"Quality Metrics"** panel showing:
- ‚úÖ Overall quality score

- ‚úÖ Validation quality
- ‚úÖ Summary quality
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Quality Dashboard (Phase 3 Step 4)

Check narrative for:
- ‚úÖ Consistent medical writing style
- ‚úÖ Proper abbreviation expansion (e.g., "subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)")
- ‚úÖ Smooth transitions between sentences
- ‚úÖ Correct tense usage

  - [ ] TEMPORAL (e.g., "POD 3 after craniotomy")
  - [ ] CONTRAINDICATION (e.g., "Aspirin held due to bleeding")
  - [ ] INDICATION (e.g., "EVD placed for hydrocephalus")
  - [ ] COMPLICATION (e.g., "Vasospasm complicated by stroke")
  - [ ] PREVENTION (e.g., "Nimodipine to prevent vasospasm")
- [ ] Relationships deduplicated
- [ ] Confidence scores assigned

### **Phase 2 Step 5: Intelligence Hub**

- [ ] Intelligence gathered from notes
- [ ] Pathology analysis complete
- [ ] Quality assessment calculated
- [ ] Completeness checked

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: Tests fail with import errors**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/app/DCS

# Run build to check for syntax errors
npm run build
```

### **Issue: Intelligence Hub errors**

**Solution:**
- This is expected if learning engine database is not initialized
- Error is handled gracefully with empty patterns
- Will be fully functional in Phase 4

### **Issue: Quality metrics show 0%**

**Solution:**
- Check that extracted data has required fields
- Verify summary text is not empty
- Check console for error messages

### **Issue: UI doesn't show new components**

**Solution:**
1. Rebuild the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Restart the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
