PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHAB CONSULT
Date: 09/22/2025
=====================================

Thank you for consulting PM&R for spinal cord injury management

HISTORY: 67M with acute C5-6 SCI ASIA C s/p ORIF, now POD2

EXAM:
MS: Alert, oriented, tearful
Motor: 
- C5 [5/5] bilat
- C6 [4/5] bilat  
- C7 [3/5] bilat
- C8 [2/5] bilat
- T1 and below [0/5]
Sensory: C5 dermatomal level
Deep tendon reflexes: absent throughout (spinal shock)
Tone: flaccid
Rectal: no tone, no sensation

ASIA CLASSIFICATION: C7 ASIA C incomplete SCI

PROGNOSIS: 
Early to predict but incomplete injury offers some hope for recovery. Upper extremity function may improve. Lower extremity recovery uncertain. Most recovery occurs in first 6-12 months, with most dramatic gains in first 3 months. Given age and comorbidities, prognosis more guarded than younger patient.

COMPLICATIONS TO MONITOR:
- DVT/PE (high risk)
- Autonomic dysreflexia (once spinal shock resolves)
- Heterotopic ossification
- Pressure ulcers
- Neurogenic bladder/bowel
- Pneumonia
- Depression/adjustment disorder

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Early mobilization - get OOB to chair when spine stable
2. Aggressive DVT prophylaxis - recommend lovenox 40mg SQ daily starting POD3
3. Bowel program - docusate, senna, scheduled digital stim/suppositories
4. Bladder: intermittent cath q4-6h vs indwelling (discuss with urology)
5. Pressure ulcer prevention - turn q2h, specialty mattress
6. Hand/wrist splinting to prevent contractures
7. ROM exercises BID
8. Psychiatry consult for depression management
9. Plan for acute inpatient rehab when medically stable (2-3 weeks)
10. Continue ASA for cardiac history
11. Monitor for autonomic dysreflexia once spinal shock resolves

Will follow closely. Patient and wife very tearful but engaged. Extensive education provided.

PSYCHIATRY CONSULT
Date: 09/23/2025
=====================================

Consulted for depression in setting of new SCI

HPI: 67M POD3 s/p C5-6 SCI with paralysis, now with depressed mood, tearfulness, poor sleep, statements like "I wish I had died" and "I'm a burden."

EXAM:
Appearance: Tearful throughout interview
Mood: "Devastated"
Affect: Depressed, congruent
Thought process: Linear and goal-directed
Thought content: No current SI/HI but states "wouldn't care if I died," denies plan
Insight: Good - understands injury
Judgment: Fair

ASSESSMENT: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood, acute, in setting of catastrophic injury. Understandable reaction. No acute safety concerns currently.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Start sertraline 50mg daily for mood (has bladder, sexual, bowel benefits in SCI)
2. Supportive psychotherapy - will see 2x week
3. Involve social work for family support
4. Peer mentoring program - connect with other SCI survivors
5. Closely monitor for worsening SI
6. Family meeting to discuss adjustment process
7. Ensure adequate pain control - undertreated pain worsens mood
8. Sleep hygiene, consider trazodone if needed

Will follow closely during hospitalization.

PROGRESS NOTE - POD 10
Date: 09/30/2025
=====================================

Events: Developed acute SOB at 4am, O2 sat 88% RA, tachypneic to 28. CTA chest showed bilateral PE.

Exam:
Tachypneic, labored breathing
O2 requirement: 4L NC to keep sat >92%
Tachycardic to 105
Motor/sensory: unchanged

CTA: Bilateral segmental and subsegmental PE

D-dimer: >5000
Troponin: 0.08 (mildly elevated)

A/P: POD10, now with PE despite prophylactic lovenox
- Discussed with hematology - recommend IVC filter given high bleeding risk with therapeutic anticoagulation so early post-op
- IR placing filter today
- Will do prophylactic, not therapeutic AC given recent surgery
- Close monitoring

This is unfortunate complication but not uncommon in SCI patients.

Dr. Patterson

=====================================
HEMATOLOGY/THROMBOSIS CONSULT - PE Management
Date: 09/30/2025 14:00
=====================================

Consulted for PE management in high-risk patient

HPI: 67M POD10 s/p C-spine fusion for SCI, on lovenox 40mg daily prophylaxis, now with bilateral PE

PMH: SCI, CAD, HTN, DM
Current anticoag: Lovenox 40mg SQ daily

EXAM:
VS: HR 102, RR 24, O2 sat 93% on 4L
Lungs: Clear, no wheezing
CV: Tachycardic
Extremities: No edema, no calf tenderness

STUDIES:
CTA: Bilateral segmental and subsegmental PE
Echo: Normal RV function, no strain
Wells score: 4.5 (PE likely)

LABS: D-dimer >5000

ASSESSMENT: Submassive bilateral PE in patient POD10 from major spine surgery with spinal cord injury

RISK STRATIFICATION:
- Hemodynamically stable
- No RV dysfunction
- Low-intermediate risk PE

ANTICOAGULATION CHALLENGES:
- Recent spine surgery (POD10) - bleeding risk
- Spinal cord injury - bleeding into cord catastrophic
- However, recurrent PE risk very high without adequate treatment

OPTIONS:
1. IVC filter + prophylactic anticoagulation (safest for bleeding)
2. IVC filter + therapeutic anticoagulation (best for PE treatment)
3. Therapeutic anticoagulation alone

RECOMMENDATION:
Given recent surgery and catastrophic consequences of spinal hematoma, recommend:
1. Retrievable IVC filter placement TODAY
2. Continue prophylactic dose lovenox 40mg daily x 2 more weeks
3. Transition to therapeutic anticoagulation (lovenox 1mg/kg q12h) at POD21 if no complications
4. F/u imaging in 1 week
5. Consider filter removal at 3-6 months if doing well on anticoagulation
6. Close neuro monitoring - any new deficits, stat imaging

Discussed with Dr. Patterson and patient/family who agree.

Date of Admission: 09/20/2025
Date of Discharge: 10/13/2025
Length of Stay: 23 days
Attending Physician: Dr. Patterson, Neurosurgery

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS

C5-6 bilateral facet dislocation with incomplete spinal cord injury (ASIA C)

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES

Neurogenic shock - resolved

Coronary artery disease status post stent placement (2020)


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Mr. Chen is a 67-year-old male who presented as a Level 2 trauma activation following an 8-foot fall from a ladder, landing on his head and neck. He experienced immediate onset of quadriparesis with preserved upper extremity function but complete lower extremity paralysis. Initial neurological examination revealed an incomplete C7 ASIA C spinal cord injury with absent rectal tone and sensation.

HOSPITAL COURSE
Initial Management
The patient presented with neurogenic shock (BP 88/54, HR 58) requiring vasopressor support with phenylephrine to maintain MAP >85-90 mmHg. Emergent imaging revealed C5-6 bilateral facet dislocation with >75% canal compromise and significant spinal cord edema from C4-7.
Surgical Intervention (09/20/2025)
After unsuccessful closed reduction in the emergency department, the patient underwent emergent:

Open reduction of C5-6 bilateral facet dislocation
Posterior cervical fusion C4-7 with lateral mass screws and rods
Intraoperative neuromonitoring showed no deterioration from baseline

Post-operatively, the patient required ICU monitoring with continued vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation for airway protection given anticipated cervical swelling. He was successfully extubated on POD1 and weaned off pressors by POD3.
Major Complications and Management
1. Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism (POD10)
Despite prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin 40mg daily, the patient developed bilateral segmental and subsegmental PE presenting with acute dyspnea and hypoxemia. Given the high bleeding risk from recent spine surgery, management included:

Placement of retrievable IVC filter
Continuation of prophylactic anticoagulation
Plan to transition to therapeutic anticoagulation at POD21

2. Postoperative Wound Infection (POD14)
The patient developed MRSA deep wound infection requiring:

Emergent irrigation and debridement with hardware retention
Second-look operation with primary closure over drain
Six-week course of IV vancomycin via PICC line (2 weeks completed, 4 weeks remaining)

3. Urinary Tract Infection (POD8)
Successfully treated with 5-day course of ceftriaxone.

NEUROLOGICAL RECOVERY
Initial examination showed complete lower extremity paralysis with partial upper extremity preservation. The patient remained in spinal shock until approximately POD10. By POD20, encouraging recovery was noted:

Motor: Trace movement (1/5) in left quadriceps; right lower extremity remains plegic; upper extremity intrinsics improved to 3/5 strength
Sensory: Persistent C5 dermatomal level
Reflexes: Return of deep tendon reflexes (2+ patellar) indicating resolution of spinal shock


FUNCTIONAL STATUS AT DISCHARGE

Mobility: Wheelchair-dependent; transfers with minimal to moderate assistance
ADLs: Modified independent for feeding and grooming with adaptive equipment; requires assistance for bathing and lower body dressing
Bowel/Bladder: Established bowel program with suppositories every 2-3 days; neurogenic bladder managed with intermittent catheterization every 6 hours

Infectious Disease: 1 week (vancomycin monitoring)
Hematology: 2 weeks (anticoagulation management and IVC filter planning)
Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation: To follow at rehabilitation facility


DISPOSITION
The patient is being transferred to the Regional Spinal Cord Injury Center for comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation. Anticipated length of rehabilitation: 4-8 weeks.

PROGNOSIS AND EDUCATION
The patient has an incomplete C7 ASIA C spinal cord injury with early signs of motor recovery, which is prognostically favorable. Most neurological recovery occurs within the first year, with the majority in the first 3-6 months. The recent return of trace motor function in the left lower extremity is encouraging and suggests potential for further recovery, though the extent remains uncertain.
The patient and family received extensive education regarding:

Recognition and management of autonomic dysreflexia
Deep vein thrombosis prevention
Skin integrity and pressure ulcer prevention
Neurogenic bowel and bladder management
Signs of infection
Home modifications that will likely be required

The interdisciplinary team emphasized that recovery is a gradual process requiring patience and persistence. The patient demonstrated good understanding and expressed motivation for rehabilitation despite appropriate emotional adjustment to this life-changing injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND ED COURSE: Mr. Chen is a 67-year-old male with a history of HTN, DM2, BPH, and CAD who presented as a Level 2 Trauma activation on 09/20/2025 after falling approximately 8 feet from a ladder, landing on his head and neck. At the scene, he reported neck pain and the inability to move his legs, with preserved movement in his arms.

Upon arrival at the ED, he was GCS 15, alert and oriented. He was hypotensive (BP 88/54) and bradycardic (HR 58), consistent with neurogenic shock. Neurological examination revealed significant deficits: preserved strength in deltoids/biceps (5/5), but progressive weakness distally (Triceps 4/5, wrist extensors 3/5, finger flexors/extensors 2/5, intrinsics 0/5). He was plegic (0/5) throughout the bilateral lower extremities. Sensation was absent below T1. He was in spinal shock (absent reflexes, absent rectal tone). He was classified as ASIA C incomplete SCI.

CT and MRI C-spine demonstrated C5-C6 bilateral jumped facets with severe canal stenosis (>75% compromise), posterior ligamentous disruption, and spinal cord edema from C4-C7. He was started on a phenylephrine infusion to maintain a MAP goal >85 mmHg for spinal cord perfusion. Emergent closed reduction was attempted but was unsuccessful. He was taken emergently to the Operating Room.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1. Neurosurgery and Spinal Cord Injury (SCI): Mr. Chen underwent emergent open reduction of the C5-6 dislocation and posterior cervical fusion C4-C7 on 09/20/2025. Reduction was achieved, and instrumentation was successfully placed. Postoperatively, he was admitted to the SICU. His neurological exam immediately post-op was unchanged from his preoperative baseline. PM&R confirmed the classification as C7 ASIA C incomplete SCI. Spinal shock persisted for approximately 12 days, characterized by flaccidity and absent reflexes. By POD 12, reflexes returned (initially 1+, later becoming hyperreflexic), indicating resolution of spinal shock. On POD 20, encouraging neurological recovery was observed. He demonstrated a trace flicker (1/5) in the left quadriceps muscle. His upper extremity function also improved, with C8/T1 strength improving to 3/5 bilaterally.

2. Cardiovascular / Neurogenic Shock: The patient required vasopressor support (phenylephrine) upon admission for neurogenic shock with a MAP goal >85. He was successfully weaned off pressors by POD 4 and transferred from the SICU to the spine unit.

3. Pulmonary / Hematology (PE): The patient was intubated postoperatively for airway protection and was successfully extubated on POD 1. He was started on prophylactic Lovenox 40mg SQ daily on POD 3. On POD 10, the hospitalization was complicated by acute shortness of breath and hypoxia. CTA chest confirmed bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Hematology was consulted. Given the high risk of spinal hematoma shortly after major surgery, therapeutic anticoagulation was deferred. A retrievable IVC filter was placed by IR on 09/30/2025, and prophylactic Lovenox was continued. His respiratory status stabilized. The plan, confirmed with Hematology, is to transition to therapeutic anticoagulation starting POD 21.

4. Infectious Disease (SSI): The patient developed a UTI around POD 8, treated with ceftriaxone. On POD 14, he developed recurrent fevers (102.4°F) and wound erythema. MRI revealed a posterior fluid collection concerning for infection. He was taken urgently to the OR on 10/04 for I&D. Purulent material was found deep to the fascia; hardware was stable and retained. He underwent a second washout on 10/05 with delayed closure. Cultures grew MRSA. ID recommended a 6-week course of IV Vancomycin. A PICC line was placed for ongoing treatment. At discharge, the infection was resolving, and he was afebrile with a clean wound.

5. Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R) / PT/OT: The patient participated actively in therapy twice daily. He made significant functional gains. At discharge, he was able to perform transfers with minimal-to-moderate assistance, had improved sitting balance, and was modified independent for feeding and grooming with adaptive equipment setup. He remains wheelchair-dependent.

6. Psychiatry: Psychiatry was consulted for adjustment disorder with depressed mood and passive suicidal ideation. He was started on Sertraline 50mg daily and engaged in supportive psychotherapy. His mood improved substantially, particularly after noting motor recovery.

7. GU/GI: The patient has a neurogenic bladder managed with intermittent catheterization every 6 hours, per Urology recommendations. A bowel regimen including Docusate, Senna, and scheduled suppositories was established.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Medically stable. Afebrile. Vitals within normal limits.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: General: Alert, oriented, cooperative. Mood improved and hopeful. Surgical Site: Posterior cervical incision is clean, dry, and intact. Extremities: Right upper extremity PICC line in place, dressing clean and dry. Neurological Status (C7 ASIA C Incomplete SCI):

Discharge Summary — Neurosurgical Spine Trauma

Patient: Robert Chen  
MRN: 45678912  
DOB/Age: 67-year-old male  
Attending Surgeon: Dr. Patterson  
Primary Diagnosis: Traumatic C5–6 bilateral facet dislocation with incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (initial ASIA C), postoperative posterior cervical fusion C4–7  
Secondary Diagnoses/Complications: Neurogenic shock, postoperative MRSA wound infection (deep), pulmonary embolism (bilateral segmental/subsegmental), urinary tract infection, adjustment disorder with depressed mood

Admission: 09/20/2025 (Level 2 trauma activation)  
Discharge/Transfer Date: 10/13/2025  
Disposition: Transfer to Regional SCI Center (acute inpatient spinal cord injury rehabilitation)

Reason for Hospitalization
Patient sustained a ground-level fall from a ladder (~8 ft), landing on head/neck with immediate paralysis of lower extremities and neck pain. Imaging demonstrated C5–6 bilateral jumped facets with severe canal compromise and spinal cord edema. He underwent emergent open reduction of C5–6 and posterior fusion C4–7 with intraoperative neuromonitoring. Hospital course complicated by neurogenic shock, unsuccessful closed reduction in ED, postoperative MRSA wound infection requiring two washouts with primary closure and prolonged IV antibiotics, pulmonary embolism requiring IVC filter placement, and urinary tract infection. Rehabilitation readiness achieved with improving neurologic function.

Hospital Course (chronologic highlights)
- 09/20/2025: Trauma activation; CT cervical spine: C5–6 bilateral facet dislocation with >75% canal compromise. MRI: cord edema C4–C7, posterior ligamentous complex disruption. ASIA C incomplete SCI on presentation (motor preservation in upper extremities; plegic lower extremities; sensory level ~T1; absent rectal tone; bulbocavernosus reflex absent; priapism present). Neurogenic shock managed with fluids and vasopressors.
- 09/20/2025 23:15: Emergent operative open reduction C5–6 and posterior C4–7 lateral mass screw-rod fusion performed by Dr. Patterson with IONM. Reduction achieved; no intraoperative complications. Patient intubated postoperatively for airway protection.
- POD0–POD2: ICU care with MAP goal >85 mmHg, phenylephrine wean. Extubated POD1. Neuro exam remained at baseline post-op—no new deficits.
- Early course: PT/OT, PM&R, psychiatry, and SCI nursing consultations. Family meetings completed; informed consent and goals discussed.
- POD8: Febrile; UA positive — treated for UTI with ceftriaxone.
- POD10: Acute SOB and hypoxemia; CTA confirmed bilateral segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Hematology recommended retrievable IVC filter placement due to recent spine surgery and risk of spinal hematoma with full anticoagulation. IVC filter placed POD10. Continued prophylactic enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily with plan to escalate per hematology guidance.
- POD14: Recurrent fevers and elevated inflammatory markers; MRI revealed postoperative fluid collection posterior to hardware. ID recommended empiric IV vancomycin + ceftazidime and urgent OR washout.
- 10/04/2025: Irrigation and debridement with cultures obtained; purulent material found. Hardware stable and left in place. Gram stain with GPC clusters.
- POD16: Second washout; wound closed over drain. Cultures grew MRSA sensitive to vancomycin. Vancomycin continued; PICC placed for prolonged IV therapy.
- Subsequent course: Afebrile, wound improved. Neuro status began to show recovery: reflexes returned (spinal shock resolution), trace voluntary movement in left lower extremity on POD20 (L quad 1/5), improved distal UE strength (C8/T1 changes), overall ASIA level now C7, still incomplete SCI.
- Psych: Started sertraline 50 mg daily; supportive therapy engaged.
- DVT/PE management: IVC filter in place; continued prophylactic enoxaparin. Hematology plan to consider escalation to therapeutic dosing at POD21 if safe; follow-up arranged.
- Disposition planning: Patient medically optimized for transfer to inpatient spinal cord injury rehabilitation on 10/13/2025.

Condition at Transfer/Discharge

  - Improve sitting balance and tolerance
  - Mobility training for wheelchair independence
  - Bowel/bladder training and independence with intermittent catheterization
  - Skin protection and pressure-relief strategies
  - Psychological coping and community reintegration planning
- Anticipated 4–8 weeks inpatient program, then transition to home with outpatient therapy and home health support as needed.

Patient/Family Education and Counseling
- Reviewed diagnosis, hospital course, complications (PE, wound infection), and prognosis. Discussed realistic expectations regarding neurologic recovery—most improvement within first 3–12 months; incomplete injury offers potential for continued gains but amount cannot be guaranteed. Education provided on autonomic dysreflexia recognition, bowel/bladder program, skin care, DVT/PE precautions, PICC care and IV antibiotic precautions. Family engaged in planning and resources; social work involved.

Significant Clinical Changes Since Admission
- Successful emergent reduction and stabilization of C5–6 with posterior C4–7 fusion.
- Major postoperative complications (MRSA wound infection requiring washouts; bilateral PE requiring IVC filter) managed successfully.
- Transition from spinal shock to return of reflexes and early motor recovery (left leg trace movement; improved distal UE strength).
