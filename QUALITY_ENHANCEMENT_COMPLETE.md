- **Confidence scoring** to indicate assessment reliability

### ðŸ“Š Detailed Metrics
```javascript
{
  overall: {
    score: 0.68,           // Overall quality score
    percentage: 68,        // Percentage representation
    rating: "Poor",        // Human-readable rating
    confidence: 0.30       // Assessment confidence
  },
  dimensions: {
    completeness: { score: 0.13, weight: 0.30, issues: [...] },
    accuracy: { score: 1.00, weight: 0.25, issues: [...] },
    consistency: { score: 1.00, weight: 0.20, issues: [...] },
    narrativeQuality: { score: 0.83, weight: 0.15, issues: [...] },
    specificity: { score: 0.74, weight: 0.05, issues: [...] },
    timeliness: { score: 0.58, weight: 0.05, bottlenecks: [...] }
  },
  recommendations: [
    { priority: "high", action: "Add missing critical sections", ... },
    { priority: "critical", action: "Address critical issues", ... }
  ]
}
```

### ðŸ”§ Integration Points

The quality system integrates seamlessly with:
- **Extraction Service**: Validates extracted data accuracy
- **Narrative Engine**: Assesses generated narrative quality
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks processing times
- **Feature Flags**: Safe rollout via `USE_6_DIMENSION_QUALITY`

## Test Results

Initial test on Robert Chen case:
- **Overall Score**: 68% (Below 70% threshold)
- **Strengths**:
  - Accuracy: 100% (perfect data extraction)
  - Consistency: 100% (no contradictions)
  - Narrative Quality: 83% (good medical writing)
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Completeness: 13% (missing critical sections in narrative)
  - Timeliness: 58% (processing too slow)
  - Specificity: 74% (some vague language)

## Architecture Benefits

   - Not just accuracy, but readability and utility

2. **Diagnostic Capability**
   - Pinpoints exact issues
   - Provides specific suggestions for improvement

3. **Weighted Scoring**
   - Prioritizes critical dimensions (completeness, accuracy)
   - Balanced evaluation across all aspects

4. **Backward Compatible**

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { calculateQualityMetrics } from './src/services/qualityMetrics.js';

const quality = calculateQualityMetrics(
  extractedData,    // Extracted medical data
  narrative,        // Generated narrative
  sourceNotes,      // Original clinical notes
  performanceMetrics, // Timing data
  options          // Configuration options
);

console.log(`Quality Score: ${quality.overall.percentage}%`);
console.log(`Rating: ${quality.overall.rating.rating}`);
```

### Configuration Options
```javascript
const options = {
  strictMode: true,           // Apply strict validation rules
  strictValidation: true,     // Enforce accuracy checks
  checkHallucinations: true,  // Detect AI hallucinations
  checkCrossReferences: true, // Validate internal references
  checkReadability: true,     // Assess readability metrics
  checkProfessionalism: true, // Check professional tone
  requirePreciseValues: true, // Enforce specific values
  checkDataFreshness: true,   // Validate data recency
  targetProcessingTime: 2000, // Target 2 seconds
  maxAcceptableTime: 5000    // Max 5 seconds
};
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Narrative Completeness**
   - Current score: 13% (Critical)
   - Ensure all critical sections are generated
   - Map extracted data to narrative sections

2. **Optimize Processing Speed**
   - Current: 29.9 seconds (Target: 2 seconds)
   - Narrative generation is the bottleneck (65%)
   - Consider caching, streaming, or faster models

3. **Improve Specificity**
   - Replace vague terms with specific values
   - Add precise measurements and dates
   - Use exact medication names and doses

### Future Enhancements
1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Train models on quality scores
   - Predict quality before generation
   - Auto-correct common issues

2. **Real-time Feedback**
   - Stream quality metrics during generation
   - Early stopping for low-quality outputs
   - Progressive enhancement

3. **Quality Thresholds**
   - Configurable minimum scores per dimension
   - Automatic retries for failed dimensions
   - Quality gates for production

## Conclusion

The 6-Dimension Quality Metrics System represents a significant advancement in the DCS system's ability to self-assess and improve. By providing detailed, actionable feedback across multiple dimensions, it enables:

- **Better patient safety** through accuracy validation
- **Improved clinical utility** through completeness checks
- **Enhanced readability** through narrative quality assessment
- **Optimal performance** through timeliness tracking

The system is production-ready with feature flag control, comprehensive testing, and backward compatibility. While the initial test shows areas for improvement (particularly in completeness), the framework itself is robust and provides clear paths for enhancement.
