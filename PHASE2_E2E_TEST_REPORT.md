## Conclusion

Phase 2 Clinical Intelligence system demonstrates **70% success rate** in real-world end-to-end testing across diverse neurosurgical scenarios.

The system successfully:
- ✓ Builds causal timelines from unstructured clinical text
- ✓ Tracks treatment-outcome relationships
- ✓ Analyzes functional evolution trajectories
- ✓ Handles multiple scoring systems (NIHSS, mRS, KPS, ECOG, ASIA, GCS, SCIM, Barthel)
- ✓ Detects clinical relationships and milestones
- ✓ Calculates effectiveness scores for interventions

**Status:** REQUIRES TUNING
