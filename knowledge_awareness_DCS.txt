Comprehensive Neurosurgical Clinical Framework
I. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION COMPONENTS
Initial Assessment (Baseline Documentation)
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): Document Eye (1-4), Verbal (1-5), Motor (1-6) components separately. Serial assessments critical for detecting deterioration. Any decline ≥2 points warrants immediate imaging.
Pupillary Examination: Size (mm), reactivity (brisk/sluggish/fixed), symmetry. Document as "3mm reactive bilaterally" or "4mm right, 2mm left, both reactive." Anisocoria >1mm significant. Fixed dilated pupil = uncal herniation until proven otherwise.
Extraocular Movements (EOM): Test CN III, IV, VI. Document diplopia, gaze preferences, nystagmus. "EOMI" (extraocular movements intact) or specify deficits. Sixth nerve palsy = elevated ICP consideration.
Motor Examination:
	•	Power: Grade 0-5 bilaterally in all extremities (deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extension, grip, hip flexion, knee extension/flexion, dorsiflexion, plantarflexion)
	•	Drift: Pronator drift with arms extended, palms up, eyes closed for 10 seconds. Subtle weakness detector.
	•	Full Motor Exam: Include tone, coordination (finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin), gait if possible
Sensory Examination:
	•	Face: V1, V2, V3 distribution light touch/pinprick
	•	Body: Dermatomal patterns, proprioception, distinguish cortical vs. peripheral patterns
II. SPINE-SPECIFIC EXAMINATION
Critical Components:
	•	Radicular Pain: Dermatomal distribution, Spurling's test, straight leg raise
	•	Myelopathy Signs: Hoffmann's sign, Babinski, clonus, hyperreflexia, inverted radial reflex, broad-based gait
	•	Rectal Tone: Document as "present/diminished/absent" - critical for cauda equina assessment
	•	Saddle Anesthesia: Perianal sensation testing - hallmark of cauda equina syndrome
	•	Bowel/Bladder Dysfunction: Urinary retention (most sensitive early finding), incontinence, constipation
	•	Post-Void Residual (PVR): Bladder scan post-void. >100-200cc abnormal, >500cc concerning. Emergent decompression if acute with other findings.
Postoperative Spine Imaging:
	•	CT spine with reconstructions: Hardware position, alignment, bone graft placement
	•	Upright spine radiographs: Assess instrumentation, sagittal balance, compare to pre-op
	•	MRI if new deficit: Rule out epidural hematoma, cord compression
III. POSTOPERATIVE DEFICIT DETECTION
Systematic Approach: Compare every examination to preoperative baseline AND prior postop exams. Document timing precisely.
Critical Syndromes:
Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome:
	•	Post-spinal fusion (especially scoliosis correction with significant lengthening)
	•	Presents: Nausea, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, postprandial pain
	•	Pathophysiology: Acute angle between SMA and aorta compresses duodenum (third portion)
	•	Diagnosis: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast, upper GI series
	•	Management: NPO, NGT decompression, aggressive hydration, prone positioning, nutritional support (TPN/NJ tube if prolonged). Surgical duodenojejunostomy if conservative fails.
Postoperative Neurological Decline:
	•	Immediate (<24hrs): Epidural hematoma, wrong-level surgery, hardware malposition, VAI (vertebral artery injury)
	•	Early (24-72hrs): Edema progression, delayed hematoma, infection, hardware failure
	•	Late (>72hrs): Meningitis, CSF leak complications, pseudarthrosis
Functional Outcome Measures:
	•	mRS (modified Rankin Scale): 0-6, document pre/postop
	•	KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status): 0-100
	•	NIHSS: For stroke patients
	•	Nurick/JOA/NDI: For cervical myelopathy
	•	ODI (Oswestry Disability Index): For lumbar pathology
IV. INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS
Postoperative Meningitis
Clinical Presentation:
	•	Fever, headache, neck stiffness, altered mental status, photophobia
	•	May be subtle postop (distinguish from expected postop symptoms)
	•	High index of suspicion if CSF leak present
Diagnostic Workup (chronological sequence):
	1	Blood Cultures × 2 sets (before antibiotics if possible)
	2	CBC with differential: Leukocytosis, left shift, bandemia
	3	CRP/ESR: Trend serially (CRP more acute phase, peaks 48hrs)
	4	Blood Chemistries: Including procalcitonin (bacterial infection marker)
	5	CSF Analysis via LP (if no contraindication):
CSF Tube Distribution:
	•	Tube 1: Gram stain, culture, sensitivity
	•	Tube 2: Protein, glucose (compare serum glucose)
	•	Tube 3: Cell count with differential
	•	Tube 4: Additional studies (viral PCR, fungal cultures, AFB if indicated)
CSF Interpretation (Bacterial Meningitis):
	•	Opening pressure: Elevated (>25 cm H2O)
	•	WBC: >1000 cells/μL (PMN predominance >80%)
	•	Protein: Elevated (>200 mg/dL, often >500)
	•	Glucose: Low (<40 mg/dL or CSF:serum ratio <0.4)
	•	Gram stain: Positive in 60-90% bacterial meningitis
Post-neurosurgical Meningitis Considerations:
	•	Aseptic/Chemical Meningitis: Can occur from surgical irritation, blood products. CSF pleocytosis with negative cultures, resolves without antibiotics.
	•	Common Organisms:
	•	Staph aureus (including MRSA)
	•	Coagulase-negative Staph (esp. with hardware)
	•	Gram-negatives (Pseudomonas, E. coli)
	•	Propionibacterium acnes (delayed, indolent)
Treatment Protocol:
	1	Empiric Antibiotics (start immediately after cultures, don't delay for LP if unstable):
	•	Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (for MRSA, target trough 15-20)
	•	PLUS Cefepime 2g IV q8h or Meropenem 2g IV q8h
	•	Adjust based on culture/sensitivity
	2	Infectious Disease Consult: Within 24hrs of diagnosis
	•	Antibiotic selection/duration
	•	Source control assessment
	•	Monitoring plan
	3	Duration:
	•	Uncomplicated: 10-14 days IV
	•	Hardware-associated: 4-6 weeks minimum
	•	Organism-dependent (Pseudomonas often 3 weeks minimum)
	4	PICC Line Insertion:
	•	For prolonged IV antibiotic therapy
	•	Placed by IR or trained RN
	•	CXR confirmation of tip position (lower SVC/cavoatrial junction)
	•	Monitor for complications: infection, thrombosis, malfunction
	5	Monitoring:
	•	Daily clinical assessment
	•	CBC, CRP/ESR every 2-3 days initially, then weekly
	•	Repeat LP in 48-72hrs if not improving
	•	Weekly LFTs, Cr while on antibiotics
	6	ID Follow-up:
	•	Outpatient ID clinic post-discharge
	•	Weekly labs (CBC, CMP, CRP)
	•	PICC line maintenance/monitoring
	•	Complete antibiotic course
	•	Repeat imaging if indicated
	7	Final Disposition Plan:
	•	Complete antibiotic course documented
	•	Home with home health for PICC line care and IV antibiotics, OR
	•	Skilled nursing facility if cannot manage at home
	•	Outpatient ID follow-up appointment scheduled
	•	PICC removal planned after antibiotic completion
V. SEIZURE MANAGEMENT
New Postoperative Seizures:
	•	Incidence: 15-30% supratentorial craniotomy patients
	•	Timing: Immediate (<24hrs), early (<1 week), late (>1 week)
	•	Risk Factors: Cortical involvement, hemorrhage, edema, metabolic derangements
Workup:
	•	Stat labs: Glucose, electrolytes, Ca, Mg, AED levels if on medication
	•	Stat CT head: Rule out hemorrhage, stroke, increased ICP
	•	EEG: If concern for subclinical seizures, status epilepticus, or recurrent seizures
Treatment:
	1	Acute Management: Lorazepam 2-4mg IV or Levetiracetam 1000-1500mg IV loading dose
	2	Maintenance AED:
	•	Levetiracetam 500-1000mg BID (preferred, no drug interactions)
	•	Phenytoin/fosphenytoin (if not on already, monitor levels)
	•	Lacosamide 100-200mg BID (alternative)
	3	Neurology Consult:
	•	AED selection and dosing
	•	EEG interpretation
	•	Duration of treatment (usually 3-12 months postop, longer if tumor/structural lesion)
	•	Weaning plan
Seizure Recurrence:
	•	Reassess compliance, drug levels
	•	Consider AED adjustment or addition
	•	Repeat imaging to rule out progression/recurrence
	•	Long-term EEG monitoring if refractory
VI. ANTICOAGULATION MANAGEMENT
Preoperative Assessment:
Document:

	2	Indication: A-fib, DVT/PE, mechanical valve, stent, stroke
	3	Last Dose: Date and time precisely
	4	Bridging Plan: If required (mechanical valve, recent VTE)
Preoperative Labs:
	•	Warfarin: INR day before surgery (goal <1.4 for intracranial)
	•	Heparin/LMWH: Anti-Xa levels if urgent
	•	DOACs: Consider drug-specific levels if available, timing-based otherwise
Holding Times (elective craniotomy):
	•	Warfarin: 5 days, check INR day before
	•	Apixaban/Rivaroxaban: 2-3 days (longer if renal impairment)
	•	Dabigatran: 3-5 days (renal-dependent)
	•	LMWH therapeutic: 24hrs
	•	Aspirin/Plavix: 7-10 days for elective cases
Postoperative Thrombosis Risk:
	•	High-risk procedures: Craniotomy for tumor, prolonged immobility, cancer patients
	•	VTE Prophylaxis:
	•	SCDs intraoperatively and postop until ambulatory
	•	Chemical prophylaxis timing controversial
	•	LMWH/heparin SQ typically started 24-48hrs postop if no hemorrhage on imaging
	•	DOACs typically 48-72hrs postop
Resuming Anticoagulation:
Timeline (individualized, typical):
	1	Postop imaging (CT head): 24-48hrs to rule out hemorrhage
	2	If stable: Start DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily)
	3	Therapeutic anticoagulation:
	•	Low hemorrhage risk: Day 3-5
	•	Moderate risk: Day 5-7
	•	High risk (residual tumor, hemorrhage): Week 2-4 or longer
	•	Bridging with heparin if mechanical valve
DVT/PE Development:
	•	Diagnosis: Duplex US (DVT), CTA chest (PE)
	•	Management: IVC filter consideration if cannot anticoagulate

Syndrome of Trephined (Sunken Flap Syndrome):
	•	After large decompressive craniectomy
	•	Symptoms: Headache, altered mental status, focal deficits worsening with upright position
	•	Mechanism: Atmospheric pressure on brain without bone protection, CSF dynamics altered
	•	Management: Cranioplasty (bone flap replacement or synthetic)
VIII. ENDOCRINE COMPLICATIONS
Diabetes Insipidus (DI):
	•	Pathophysiology: ADH deficiency (posterior pituitary/stalk injury)
	•	Timing: Transsphenoidal surgery (triphasic response common), skull base procedures
	•	Diagnosis:
	•	Polyuria: >3 L/day or >200-300 cc/hr for 2+ consecutive hours
	•	Hypernatremia: Na >145 (often >150)
	•	Low urine osmolality: <300 mOsm/kg with high serum osmolality
	•	High serum Na with inappropriately dilute urine
Management:
	1	Acute: DDAVP (desmopressin) 1-2 mcg IV/SQ or 0.1-0.2 mg PO
	2	Monitoring:
	•	Strict I/Os
	•	Serum Na q4-6h
	•	Urine specific gravity/osmolality
	3	Adjust DDAVP: Based on urine output and Na levels
	4	Endocrinology Consult: Within 24hrs of diagnosis
Triphasic Response (transsphenoidal surgery):
	•	Phase 1 (Days 1-5): DI from neuronal shock
	•	Phase 2 (Days 5-7): SIADH from dying neuron ADH release
	•	Phase 3 (Day 7+): Permanent DI if sufficient damage
ACTH/Cortisol Deficiency (Adrenal Insufficiency):
	•	Risk: Pituitary/hypothalamic surgery, chronic steroid use
	•	Diagnosis:
	•	Morning cortisol <3 mcg/dL (definite deficiency)
	•	3-15 mcg/dL (consider ACTH stim test)
	•	ACTH level (low in secondary insufficiency)
Stress Dose Steroids (perioperative):

	•	Week 2: 4 mg q8h → 2 mg q8h
	•	Week 3: 2 mg q8h → 2 mg q12h
	•	Week 4: 2 mg q12h → 2 mg daily → off
	•	Watch for: Steroid withdrawal symptoms, edema rebound on MRI
	•	Vasogenic Edema Management: Continue dexamethasone as needed for peritumoral edema
Glioma-Specific Monitoring:
	•	Baseline postop MRI: Within 24-72hrs (differentiate residual tumor from postop changes)
	•	Surveillance: Every 2-3 months for high-grade, every 3-6 months for low-grade
	•	Recurrence/Progression: New enhancement, FLAIR abnormality growth
	•	Pseudoprogression: Increased enhancement within 12 weeks of radiation (inflammatory, not true progression). Stable or improved by 3 months.
	•	Radiation Necrosis: Late complication, difficult to distinguish from recurrence (PET, perfusion MRI, consider biopsy)
Discharge Planning:
	•	Home Services:
	•	Home health nursing (wound checks, PICC line care, medication administration)
	•	Physical/occupational therapy
	•	DME (walker, wheelchair, hospital bed if needed)
	•	PICC Line Care: Huber needle changes, flushing protocols, infection monitoring
	•	Medication Reconciliation: Ensure proper prescriptions, education on new medications
	•	Follow-up: Neurosurgery, oncology, radiation oncology, endocrine, ID as appropriate
	•	Imaging: Schedule follow-up MRI
	•	Return Precautions: Fever, worsening headache, seizure, new deficit, wound issues
This framework enables comprehensive patient assessment, early complication detection, and systematic management of complex neurosurgical patients from admission through long-term follow-up.

	•	External collection system: Keep at level of tragus initially, then flat
	•	Secure well: Suture to scalp, additional dressing reinforcement
Drainage Protocol:
First 24 Hours:
	•	Drain open to gravity drainage
	•	Collection system at ear level or flat (avoid excessive siphoning)
	•	Monitor output hourly
	•	Expected: 50-200cc in first 24hrs

Anticoagulation Resumption:
	•	Hold minimum 72hrs post-procedure
	•	Restart when CT stable (typically 5-7 days)
	•	Consider MRI to confirm absence of microhemorrhages if high-risk indication
XI. NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS (NPH)
Clinical Syndrome - Hakim's Triad
1. Gait Disturbance (earliest, most responsive to treatment):
	•	Magnetic gait: Feet appear "stuck to floor," shuffling
	•	Wide-based: Decreased step height, length
	•	Apraxia: Difficulty initiating gait
	•	Turning: En bloc, multiple steps, instability
	•	Falls: Common, especially backward falls
2. Cognitive Impairment (subcortical pattern):
	•	Bradyphrenia: Psychomotor slowing
	•	Executive Dysfunction: Poor planning, attention
	•	Memory: Retrieval deficits (recognition better than recall)
	•	Apathy, abulia: Lack of initiative
	•	Distinguish from Alzheimer's: NPH is subcortical, AD is cortical (language, recognition affected)
3. Urinary Incontinence (late finding):
	•	Urgency: Initially
	•	Frequency: Nocturia
	•	Incontinence: Late stage, after gait and cognition
Diagnosis
Imaging - MRI Brain:
	•	Ventriculomegaly: Evans index >0.3 (ratio frontal horn width to inner skull diameter)
	•	Disproportionate Ventricular Enlargement: Large ventricles, relatively preserved sulci
	•	Corpus Callosum: Upward bowing, acute callosal angle
	•	Flow Void: Prominent aqueductal flow void on T2
	•	Periventricular Changes: FLAIR hyperintensity (transependymal CSF flow)
	•	Tight High Convexity: Crowded sulci at vertex
Supplementary Tests:
	•	Extended Lumbar Drainage: 3-day continuous drainage via lumbar drain
	•	CSF Tap Test (Large Volume LP): See below
	•	CSF Infusion Test/Resistance to Outflow (Rout): Specialized centers
	•	Intracranial Pressure Monitoring: B-waves on overnight ICP monitoring
Large Volume Lumbar Puncture (High Volume Tap Test)
Purpose: Predict shunt responsiveness by temporarily removing CSF
Procedure:
	1	Pre-Tap Assessment:
	•	Timed Up and Go (TUG): Time to stand, walk 10 feet, turn, return, sit
	•	30-Second Walk Test: Count steps in 30 seconds
	•	Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) or MoCA
	•	Videotape gait for comparison
	•	Document specific gait abnormalities
	2	Lumbar Puncture:
	•	Standard LP technique, L3-L4 or L4-L5
	•	Opening Pressure: Usually normal (5-18 cm H2O) - "normal pressure"
	•	Volume Removed: 30-50cc CSF (some protocols up to 70cc)
	•	Send: Cell count, glucose, protein, cultures
	3	Post-Tap Assessment (timing varies by protocol):
	•	Immediate: 1-2 hours post-tap
	•	24 hours: Most sensitive timepoint
	•	48-72 hours: Extended response
	•	Repeat TUG test: Measure improvement
	•	Repeat 30-second walk test: Increased step count
	•	Repeat cognitive testing
	•	Video gait again: Document changes
Interpretation:
Positive Response (predicts shunt success):
	•	Gait:
	•	TUG improvement >20% or >10 seconds faster
	•	Increased steps in 30-second walk (>10% increase)
	•	Qualitative improvement: Better initiation, stride length, turning
	•	Cognitive: MMSE improvement ≥2 points
	•	Any Component: Improvement in gait, cognition, or urinary symptoms
Timing of Improvement:
	•	Immediate (1-4 hours): Strong positive predictor
	•	24 hours: Most common timing for response
	•	48-72 hours: Delayed responders still may benefit from shunt
Negative/Equivocal: Consider extended lumbar drainage (3-5 days) for better assessment
Gait Assessment Details
Baseline Gait Examination (document thoroughly):
	•	Stance: Narrow vs. wide-based
	•	Initiation: Normal vs. hesitant (freezing)
	•	Stride Length: Measure in cm
	•	Step Height: Shuffling vs. normal foot clearance
	•	Arm Swing: Present vs. reduced/absent
	•	Turning: En bloc, # of steps to turn 180°
	•	Balance: Romberg, pull test
	•	Tandem Gait: Ability to walk heel-to-toe
	•	Dual Task: Gait while talking/counting (cognitive load)
Quantitative Measures:
	•	TUG: Normal <10 seconds, >14 seconds abnormal
	•	10-Meter Walk Test: Speed in m/s
	•	Step Count: 30-second or 1-minute walk
	•	Video Analysis: Review frame-by-frame with PT
Post-Tap Testing (same measures, same conditions):
	•	Test at same time of day
	•	Same environment
	•	Same assistive device (if used)
	•	Measure multiple parameters
	•	Patient often notices improvement subjectively before objective changes
Shunt Surgery for NPH
Indications:
	•	Clinical NPH triad
	•	Positive imaging findings
	•	Positive CSF tap test or extended drainage
Shunt Types:
	•	Ventriculoperitoneal (VP): Most common
	•	Ventriculoatrial (VA): If peritoneum not suitable
	•	Lumboperitoneal (LP): Selected cases (communicating hydrocephalus, no obstruction)
Valve Selection:
	•	Programmable Valves: Preferred (can adjust non-invasively)
	•	Initial Setting: Medium pressure (often 120-140 mm H2O)
	•	Anti-siphon Device: Recommended to prevent over-drainage
	•	Gravitational Units: For postural pressure changes
Postoperative Management:
Immediate (first 24-48hrs):
	•	Neuro checks Q2-4h
	•	Flat bed rest × 24hrs (some protocols)
	•	CT head: Post-op day 1 (assess ventricular size, rule out hemorrhage/pneumocephalus)
	•	Monitor for over-drainage symptoms
Early Assessment (days 2-5):
	•	Mobilization with PT
	•	Gait assessment
	•	Cognitive reassessment
	•	Watch for complications
Valve Adjustments:
	•	If Persistent Symptoms: Lower pressure setting (increase drainage)
	•	If Over-drainage: Increase pressure setting
	•	Timing: Adjust after 2-4 weeks, allow equilibration between changes
	•	Reassess: Gait testing 2-4 weeks after each adjustment
Complications
Over-Drainage:
	•	Orthostatic Headache: Worse upright, better supine
	•	Subdural Hematoma: Acute or chronic, bilateral possible
	•	Slit Ventricle Syndrome: Severe headaches, small ventricles
	•	Management: Increase valve setting, anti-siphon device, bed rest
Under-Drainage:
	•	Persistent Symptoms: No improvement in triad
	•	Ventricular Size Unchanged: On imaging
	•	Management: Lower valve pressure, check shunt series (obstruction?)
Shunt Malfunction:
	•	Obstruction: Proximal (ventricular catheter), distal (peritoneal catheter), valve
	•	Symptoms: Return of NPH symptoms or increased ICP symptoms
	•	Diagnosis: Shunt series (X-rays skull/neck/chest/abdomen), CT head, nuclear medicine shunt study
	•	Management: Shunt revision
Infection:
	•	Early (<6 months): Perioperative contamination
	•	Late: Hematogenous seeding
	•	Organisms: Staph epidermidis, S. aureus
	•	Management: Shunt removal, EVD, IV antibiotics 10-14 days, shunt replacement
Follow-up and Monitoring
Timeline:
	•	2 Weeks: Wound check, initial clinical assessment
	•	6 Weeks: Full gait and cognitive reassessment
	•	3 Months: Repeat TUG, walk tests, MoCA/MMSE, CT head
	•	6 Months: Full reassessment
	•	Annually: Ongoing monitoring
Expected Outcomes:
	•	Gait: 60-90% improvement (most responsive)
	•	Cognition: 50-70% improvement (moderate response)
	•	Urinary: 40-60% improvement (least responsive)
	•	Best Results: Early diagnosis, prominent gait dysfunction, positive tap test
Long-term Management:
	•	Regular valve checks (X-ray confirmation of setting)
	•	Adjustment as needed for symptom recurrence
	•	MRI safety considerations (most programmable valves MRI-compatible but may reset)
	•	Patient education: Symptoms of malfunction, when to seek care
	•	Shunt card: Document valve type, settings, revision history
NPH vs. Other Dementias
Distinguish From:
	•	Alzheimer's Disease: Cortical dementia (language, praxis affected), gait late, NPH gait early
	•	Parkinson's Disease: Tremor, rigidity, asymmetric onset (NPH symmetric)
	•	Vascular Dementia: Stepwise decline, white matter changes, strokes on imaging
	•	Lewy Body Dementia: Visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, REM sleep disorder
Key Differentiators for NPH:
	•	Gait prominent and early
	•	Urinary symptoms
	•	Subcortical cognitive pattern
	•	Imaging: Ventriculomegaly disproportionate to atrophy
	•	Positive tap test
This expanded framework now includes detailed protocols for CSDH drainage management and comprehensive NPH assessment/treatment, enabling systematic evaluation and management of these important neurosurgical conditions.

Pharmacologic Management
Benzodiazepines (cornerstone of treatment):
Symptom-Triggered Therapy (preferred):
	•	CIWA-Ar Q1-2h
	•	Lorazepam 1-4mg IV/PO when CIWA ≥8-10
	•	Diazepam 10-20mg IV/PO alternative
	•	Titrate to light sedation (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale -1 to 0)
	•	No maximum dose - give until symptoms controlled
Fixed-Schedule Therapy (alternative):
	•	Chlordiazepoxide 50-100mg PO Q6h × 4 doses, then taper
	•	Lorazepam 2mg PO/IV Q6h × 4 doses, then taper
	•	Plus PRN dosing for breakthrough symptoms
Severe Withdrawal/DT (ICU):
	•	Lorazepam 2-4mg IV Q5-15min until sedated
	•	Diazepam 5-10mg IV Q5-10min (long-acting, lipophilic)
	•	May require continuous IV infusion: Lorazepam 1-10mg/hr or midazolam 1-20mg/hr
	•	Phenobarbital: Adjunct if refractory (loading 10-15mg/kg, then 30-60mg Q6-8h)
	•	Propofol: Last resort for refractory DT (requires intubation)
Adjunctive Medications:
Thiamine + Nutrition:
	•	Thiamine 500mg IV TID × 3 days, then 100mg PO daily
	•	Prevent/treat Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
	•	Magnesium 2-4g IV over 30min, then 1-2g Q6h (repletes deficiency, reduces seizure risk)
	•	Folate 1mg daily
	•	Multivitamin
	•	Banana bag: 1L NS + thiamine 100mg + folate 1mg + MVI (common ICU order)
Alpha-2 Agonists (for autonomic symptoms):
	•	Dexmedetomidine 0.2-1.5 mcg/kg/hr: Reduces tachycardia, agitation; benzodiazepine-sparing
	•	Clonidine 0.1-0.2mg PO/NG Q6h: Outpatient or floor setting
	•	NOT monotherapy - always with benzodiazepines
Antipsychotics (for hallucinations/agitation):
	•	Haloperidol 2-5mg IV/IM Q30min-1hr PRN severe agitation
	•	Risk: Lowers seizure threshold, QT prolongation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome
	•	Use sparingly, only as adjunct to benzodiazepines
	•	Avoid in prolonged QTc
Beta Blockers (controversial):
	•	May mask tachycardia (warning sign of deterioration)
	•	Use only if adequate sedation achieved and tachycardia persistent
	•	Esmolol or metoprolol
Monitoring in ICU/Neurosurgical Setting
Continuous Monitoring:
	•	Telemetry (HR, rhythm - watch for arrhythmias)
	•	Automated BP Q15-30min
	•	Temperature Q1-2h
	•	O2 saturation
	•	Neuro checks Q1-2h (distinguish delirium from neurological deterioration)
Labs:
	•	Daily: CMP (renal function, electrolytes), Mg, Phos, Ca
	•	Baseline: CBC, LFTs, lipase, coags (assess liver disease, pancreatitis)
	•	PRN: Alcohol level, tox screen, ammonia (if hepatic encephalopathy suspected)
	•	EKG: Check QTc if using haloperidol
Fluid Management:
	•	Often dehydrated: 100-200cc/hr NS or LR initially
	•	Replete electrolytes aggressively (K, Mg, Phos)
	•	Monitor UOP (Foley catheter if severe withdrawal)
Distinguishing Withdrawal from Other Causes of Delirium
Must Rule Out:
	•	Infection: UTI, pneumonia, meningitis, wound infection
	•	Hemorrhage: Intracranial, especially post-neurosurgery
	•	Stroke: New ischemic event
	•	Seizures: Postictal state, nonconvulsive status epilepticus
	•	Metabolic: Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy
	•	Medications: Anticholinergics, steroids, opioids
	•	Hypoxia/Hypercapnia: Respiratory failure
Workup if Atypical Features:
	•	CT head (new focal deficit, fall, trauma)
	•	LP (fever + meningismus - rule out meningitis)
	•	EEG (rule out seizures if no improvement with sedation)
	•	Blood/urine cultures (fever, leukocytosis)
XIII. DELIRIUM (NON-ALCOHOL RELATED)
Definition and Types
Delirium: Acute confusional state with fluctuating consciousness, inattention, and cognitive dysfunction
Types:
	1	Hyperactive: Agitation, hallucinations, restlessness (25%)
	2	Hypoactive: Lethargy, decreased responsiveness, withdrawal (25%)
	3	Mixed: Alternating hyperactive/hypoactive (50%)
Hypoactive often MISSED - appears "sleepy" but is delirious
CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for ICU)
Four Features (delirium = Features 1 + 2 + either 3 or 4):
	1	Acute Onset/Fluctuating Course: Change from baseline, varies during day
	2	Inattention: Difficulty focusing, easily distractible
	3	Disorganized Thinking: Rambling, illogical, incoherent
	4	Altered Level of Consciousness: Not alert (RASS other than 0)
RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale):
	•	+4: Combative
	•	+3: Very agitated
	•	+2: Agitated
	•	+1: Restless
	•	0: Alert and calm
	•	-1: Drowsy
	•	-2: Light sedation
	•	-3: Moderate sedation
	•	-4: Deep sedation
	•	-5: Unarousable
Causes in Neurosurgical Patients (Think "I WATCH DEATH")
	•	Infection: UTI, pneumonia, meningitis, wound infection
	•	Withdrawal: Alcohol, benzodiazepines
	•	Acute metabolic: Renal/hepatic failure, electrolytes
	•	Trauma: Head injury, pain, immobilization
	•	CNS pathology: Stroke, hemorrhage, seizures, hydrocephalus
	•	Hypoxia: Respiratory failure, anemia
	•	Deficiencies: Thiamine (Wernicke's), B12
	•	Endocrine: Hyper/hypothyroid, Cushing's, Addison's
	•	Acute vascular: Stroke, MI, shock
	•	Toxins/drugs: Anticholinergics, steroids, opioids, benzos
	•	Heavy metals: (rare)
Workup
Initial Assessment:
	1	Review medications: Recent additions, opioids, anticholinergics, steroids
	2	Vital signs: Fever, hypoxia, hypotension
	3	Neuro exam: Focal deficits, mental status exam
	4	Timeline: Acute vs. gradual onset
Laboratory:
	•	CBC: Infection, anemia
	•	CMP: Na, glucose, renal function, Ca
	•	Urinalysis + culture: UTI (most common cause in elderly)
	•	Blood cultures: If febrile
	•	Ammonia: If liver disease
	•	TSH: If clinically indicated
	•	Thiamine level: Chronic alcohol use
Imaging:
	•	CT head: New stroke, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, mass effect
	•	CXR: Pneumonia, aspiration
Other:
	•	EEG: If concern for nonconvulsive seizures (look for triphasic waves in metabolic, seizure activity)
	•	LP: If meningitis/encephalitis suspected (fever + altered mental status + no other cause)
Management
Non-Pharmacologic (first-line):
	•	Reorient frequently: Name, date, location, why in hospital
	•	Mobilize early: Get out of bed, ambulate with PT
	•	Sleep hygiene: Minimize nighttime disruptions, lights off, quiet
	•	Sensory aids: Glasses, hearing aids
	•	Family presence: Familiar faces, reassurance
	•	Remove tethers: Foley, telemetry, IVs when safe
	•	Pain control: Adequate analgesia without over-sedation
	•	Avoid restraints: Unless absolutely necessary (increases agitation)
Pharmacologic (only if danger to self/others or non-pharm fails):
Antipsychotics:
	•	Haloperidol 0.5-2mg PO/IV/IM Q4-6h PRN (first-line)
	•	Start low in elderly (0.5mg)
	•	Max 20mg/day
	•	Risk: QT prolongation, EPS, NMS, lowers seizure threshold
	•	Quetiapine 12.5-50mg PO BID (alternative, less EPS)
	•	Better for Parkinson's/Lewy body
	•	More sedating
	•	Olanzapine 2.5-5mg PO/IM daily-BID
Contraindications:
	•	Seizure disorder (relative - lowers threshold)
	•	Parkinson's disease (haloperidol - use quetiapine instead)
	•	Prolonged QTc (>500 msec)
	•	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome history
Avoid:
	•	Benzodiazepines: Worsen delirium (except alcohol/benzo withdrawal)
	•	Diphenhydramine: Anticholinergic, worsens delirium
Special Considerations in Neurosurgical Patients
Postoperative Delirium:
	•	Very common after craniotomy (30-40%)
	•	Multifactorial: anesthesia, opioids, ICU environment, surgery itself
	•	Usually resolves in 2-5 days
	•	Requires ruling out surgical complications (hemorrhage, stroke, meningitis)
Steroid-Induced Psychosis:
	•	High-dose dexamethasone (common in neurosurgery)
	•	Presents: Mania, hallucinations, paranoia, agitation
	•	Management: Reduce dex if possible, antipsychotics, consider mood stabilizer
Distinguishing from Neurological Deterioration:
	•	Delirium: Fluctuating, inattention, no focal deficits
	•	Neurological: Progressive, focal deficits, abnormal imaging
	•	When in doubt: Get CT head
XIV. URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms:
	•	Cystitis: Dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, hematuria
	•	Pyelonephritis: Fever, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea/vomiting
	•	Catheter-Associated: Often asymptomatic, or presents as delirium/fever only
Risk Factors in Neurosurgical Patients:
	•	Foley catheter: Biggest risk (bacteriuria rate 5% per day)
	•	Neurogenic bladder (spinal cord injury)
	•	Urinary retention (use PVR to assess)
	•	Instrumentation
	•	Immunosuppression (steroids)
	•	Female sex, elderly
Diagnosis

	•	Duration: 7-14 days depending on severity
	•	Transition to PO when afebrile × 24-48hrs, tolerating PO
Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI):
	•	Remove or replace Foley before starting antibiotics
	•	Empiric antibiotics as above
	•	Tailor based on culture results
Resistant Organisms:

Prevention
Foley Catheter Management:
	•	Remove as soon as possible (most important)
	•	Daily assessment: "Does patient still need catheter?"
	•	Closed drainage system
	•	Catheter care: Keep bag below bladder, empty regularly
	•	Avoid routine catheter changes (only if obstructed, malfunctioning)
Alternatives to Indwelling Catheter:
	•	Intermittent straight catheterization (if retention)
	•	Condom catheter (males, if incontinent)
	•	Bladder scanner (monitor PVRs without catheter)
Post-Void Residual Monitoring:
	•	Use bladder scanner Q8h in at-risk patients
	•	If PVR >300-500cc → straight cath or replace Foley
	•	Goal: Empty bladder, prevent overdistension
XV. FEVER WORKUP IN NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS
Differential Diagnosis (Temporal Pattern)
Immediate (<48 hours post-op):

XVII. TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLERS (TCDs)
Indications in Neurosurgery
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH):
	•	Vasospasm monitoring (most common indication)
	•	Daily or BID during vasospasm window (days 3-14)
Other Indications:
	•	Sickle cell disease (stroke risk assessment)
	•	Brain death evaluation
	•	Assessment of collateral flow
	•	Monitoring during carotid endarterectomy
	•	Acute stroke evaluation (recanalization)
	•	Cerebral circulatory arrest
TCD Technique
Windows (bone windows for ultrasound):
	•	Transtemporal: MCA, ACA, PCA, terminal ICA
	•	Transorbital: Ophthalmic artery, ICA siphon
	•	Suboccipital: Vertebral arteries, basilar artery
	•	Submandibular: Distal ICA
Measurements:
	•	Mean Flow Velocity (MFV): Average velocity in cm/s
	•	Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV)
	•	End Diastolic Velocity (EDV)
	•	Pulsatility Index (PI): (PSV - EDV) / MFV
	•	Lindegaard Ratio: MCA velocity / ICA velocity
Vasospasm Detection (SAH)
Normal Values:
	•	MCA: MFV <100 cm/s
	•	ACA: MFV <80 cm/s
	•	ICA: MFV <60 cm/s
	•	Basilar: MFV <80 cm/s
Vasospasm Criteria (MCA, most commonly assessed):
	•	Mild: MFV 120-150 cm/s
	•	Moderate: MFV 150-200 cm/s
	•	Severe: MFV >200 cm/s
Lindegaard Ratio (differentiates vasospasm from hyperemia):
	•	<3: Hyperemia (increased flow, normal vessel)
	•	3-6: Mild-moderate vasospasm
	•	>6: Severe vasospasm
Daily Velocity Increase:
	•	>50 cm/s in 24hrs: Concerning for developing vasospasm
Clinical Correlation
TCD + Clinical Assessment:
	•	Elevated velocities + new focal deficit: Symptomatic vasospasm → aggressive treatment
	•	Elevated velocities + no symptoms: Asymptomatic vasospasm → monitor closely, prophylactic measures
	•	Normal velocities + new deficit: Look for other causes (hydrocephalus, re-bleed, seizures, metabolic)
Limitations:
	•	Operator-dependent
	•	Poor bone windows (15-20% patients, especially elderly women)
	•	Cannot detect vasospasm in distal vessels
	•	Hyperemia (fever, anemia) can falsely elevate velocities
Management Based on TCD Findings
Mild-Moderate Vasospasm:
	•	Induced Hypertension: Raise SBP to 160-200 mmHg (augment perfusion pressure)
	•	Euvolemia: Maintain adequate hydration (NS 75-100 cc/hr)
	•	Nimodipine 60mg PO/NG Q4h: Neuroprotective (continue all SAH patients × 21 days)
Severe Symptomatic Vasospasm:
	•	Hypertensive Hypervolemic Therapy (HHT):
	•	Pressors: Norepinephrine, phenylephrine to achieve SBP 180-220 mmHg
	•	IV fluids: 150-200 cc/hr, maintain CVP 8-12
	•	Angiography:
	•	Intra-arterial verapamil or nicardipine
	•	Balloon angioplasty (for proximal large vessel spasm)
	•	ICU monitoring: A-line, CVP, frequent neuro exams
Refractory Vasospasm:
	•	Maximize hemodynamics
	•	Consider milrinone infusion (cardiac inotrope, cerebral vasodilation)
	•	Repeat angiography/intervention
Brain Death Evaluation
TCD Findings in Cerebral Circulatory Arrest:
	•	Reverberating flow: Flow in systole, reversal in diastole
	•	Systolic spikes: Minimal forward flow only in systole
	•	No flow: No detectable signal despite adequate windows
Criteria: Bilateral absence of flow or reverberating flow in multiple vessels
Adjunct to clinical exam: Not sufficient alone for brain death diagnosis

Additional Neurosurgical Conditions and Management
XVIII. BRAIN ABSCESS
Pathophysiology and Stages
Formation Timeline:
	1	Early Cerebritis (Days 1-3): Inflammatory infiltrate, edema, necrosis beginning
	2	Late Cerebritis (Days 4-9): Necrotic center forms, early fibroblast response
	3	Early Capsule (Days 10-13): Collagen capsule developing
	4	Late Capsule (Day 14+): Mature collagen capsule (thinner on ventricular side)
Sources:
	•	Direct spread: Sinusitis (frontal lobe), otitis/mastoiditis (temporal lobe, cerebellum)
	•	Hematogenous: Endocarditis, dental infection, pulmonary AVM, cyanotic heart disease
	•	Post-traumatic: Penetrating injury, open skull fracture, surgery
	•	Post-neurosurgical: Craniotomy site (rare, <1%)
Clinical Presentation
Classic Triad (present in <50%):
	•	Fever
	•	Headache
	•	Focal neurological deficit
Common Symptoms:
	•	Headache: 70-90%, progressive, worse with Valsalva
	•	Fever: 50-70% (absence doesn't exclude abscess)
	•	Altered Mental Status: 65%, from mild confusion to coma
	•	Seizures: 25-45%, focal or generalized
	•	Focal Deficit: 50% - depends on location (hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field cut)
	•	Nausea/Vomiting: Increased ICP
	•	Meningismus: 25% (if adjacent to meninges or rupture)
Time Course: Symptoms develop over days to weeks (slower than bacterial meningitis)
Diagnosis
Imaging:
CT Head with Contrast:
	•	Ring-enhancing lesion with smooth thin wall
	•	Central hypodensity (necrotic core)
	•	Surrounding vasogenic edema (FLAIR hyperintensity)
	•	Mass effect: Midline shift, ventricular compression
	•	"Daughter abscesses": Satellite lesions
MRI Brain with Contrast (preferred):
	•	T1 + Gad: Thin, smooth ring enhancement
	•	T2/FLAIR: Central hyperintensity, surrounding edema
	•	DWI: Restricted diffusion (bright) in abscess cavity - KEY finding (distinguishes from tumor, necrosis)
	•	Capsule characteristics: Hypointense T2 rim (collagen/hemosiderin)
Ventriculitis: If abscess ruptures intraventricularly - poor prognosis
Laboratory:
	•	CBC: Leukocytosis (may be normal)
	•	ESR/CRP: Elevated (monitor response to treatment)
	•	Blood cultures × 2: Positive in 10-30%
	•	LP: Contraindicated if mass effect (risk herniation)
	•	Consider only if no mass effect and ventriculitis suspected
	•	CSF: Pleocytosis, elevated protein, glucose normal/low (if adjacent)
Source Workup:
	•	CT sinuses: Sinusitis (most common source)
	•	CT temporal bones: Mastoiditis, otitis
	•	Transthoracic echo (TTE): Endocarditis
	•	Dental exam: Odontogenic source
	•	Chest CT: Pulmonary source, AVM
	•	Blood cultures: Always obtain
Microbiology
Common Organisms (often polymicrobial):
	•	Streptococcus (aerobic and microaerophilic): 60-70%, especially S. milleri group
	•	Staphylococcus aureus: 10-20%, especially post-trauma, post-op, endocarditis
	•	Anaerobes: 30-50% (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Fusobacterium)
	•	Gram-negatives: Enterobacteriaceae (post-neurosurgical, immunocompromised)
	•	Fungi: Aspergillus, Candida (immunocompromised)
	•	Nocardia: Immunocompromised
	•	Toxoplasma: HIV/AIDS (multiple ring-enhancing lesions)
Culture-negative: 15-30% of cases (prior antibiotics, inadequate sampling)
Medical vs. Surgical Management
Medical Management Alone (antibiotics):
	•	Small abscess: <2-2.5 cm
	•	Multiple abscesses: Especially if small, eloquent locations
	•	Early cerebritis: Before capsule formation
	•	Surgically inaccessible: Deep, brainstem, thalamus
	•	Poor surgical candidate: Unstable, high risk
	•	Toxoplasma, Nocardia: Often respond to medical therapy
Surgical Indications:
	•	Large abscess: >2.5 cm
	•	Significant mass effect: Midline shift, impending herniation
	•	Failed medical therapy: No improvement after 2 weeks antibiotics
	•	Neurological deterioration: Progressive deficit
	•	Diagnostic uncertainty: Differentiate from tumor
	•	Gas-containing abscess: Poor antibiotic penetration
	•	Traumatic/foreign body: Contaminated wound
	•	Fungal abscess: Poor antibiotic penetration
	•	Rupture into ventricle: Requires drainage + EVD
Surgical Techniques
1. Stereotactic/Image-Guided Aspiration (preferred first-line):
Advantages: Minimally invasive, can repeat, suitable for deep/eloquent locations
Technique:
	•	Frame-based or frameless navigation
	•	Twist drill or burr hole craniotomy
	•	Needle aspiration:
	•	18G needle advanced to abscess center
	•	Aspirate purulent material (send for Gram stain, culture, cell count)
	•	May instill antibiotics into cavity (controversial)
	•	Leave drain only if large cavity or incomplete drainage
	•	Closure: Close scalp, sterile dressing
Send Specimens:
	•	Aerobic culture
	•	Anaerobic culture
	•	Fungal culture
	•	AFB culture (if immunocompromised)
	•	Gram stain (immediate)
	•	Cell count with differential
	•	Consider 16S rRNA PCR if culture-negative
Repeat Aspiration: Often needed (30-50% require 2+ aspirations)
	•	If no clinical improvement in 48-72 hours
	•	If abscess reaccumulates on imaging
2. Craniotomy with Excision:
Indications:
	•	Multiloculated abscess (aspiration inadequate)
	•	Fungal abscess (thick wall, poor drug penetration)
	•	Traumatic abscess with foreign body/bone fragments
	•	Superficial, well-encapsulated lesion
	•	Failed repeated aspirations
Technique:
	•	Standard craniotomy over abscess
	•	Minimal brain manipulation: Risk of rupture
	•	En bloc excision of entire capsule if possible
	•	Copious irrigation
	•	Hemostasis, closure
	•	Send capsule for pathology + culture
Risks: Higher morbidity than aspiration, may damage surrounding brain
3. Endoscopic Drainage:
	•	For ventricular rupture with ventriculitis
	•	EVD placement + intraventricular antibiotics
Antibiotic Therapy
Empiric Regimen (before culture results):
Standard (most cases):
	•	Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV Q8-12h (MRSA, Streptococcus)
	•	Target trough 15-20 mg/L
	•	Metronidazole 500 mg IV Q8h (anaerobes - excellent CNS penetration)
	•	Ceftriaxone 2g IV Q12h OR Cefotaxime 2g IV Q4-6h (Streptococcus, gram-negatives)
Post-Neurosurgical/Trauma:
	•	Vancomycin (MRSA, CoNS)
	•	Cefepime 2g IV Q8h OR Meropenem 2g IV Q8h (Pseudomonas, gram-negatives)
	•	Metronidazole (anaerobes)
Immunocompromised:
	•	Add Voriconazole 6mg/kg IV Q12h × 2, then 4mg/kg Q12h (Aspergillus, Candida)
	•	Consider TMP-SMX 5mg/kg IV Q6h (Nocardia, Toxoplasma)
Tailor Based on Cultures: Narrow once organism identified
Duration:
	•	Aspiration/drainage: 6-8 weeks IV antibiotics
	•	Excision: 4-6 weeks IV antibiotics
	•	Longer if: Immunocompromised, fungal, refractory, ventriculitis (8-12 weeks)
PICC Line: For prolonged IV antibiotic therapy (see Infection section)
Monitoring:
	•	Weekly CBC, CMP, LFTs (antibiotic toxicity)
	•	Weekly CRP/ESR (trend downward)
	•	MRI every 2-4 weeks (abscess size reduction, resolution of enhancement and edema)
	•	Clinical exam: Resolution of symptoms, neuro deficits
Infectious Disease Consult: Strongly recommended for antibiotic selection, duration, monitoring
Adjunctive Management
ICP Management:
	•	Dexamethasone 4-10 mg IV Q6h: For significant edema/mass effect
	•	Taper once mass effect improves
	•	Caution: May impair immune response, use judiciously
	•	Osmotherapy: Mannitol, 3% saline if acute herniation risk
	•	EVD: If hydrocephalus from mass effect
Seizure Prophylaxis:
	•	Levetiracetam 500-1000 mg PO/IV BID (preferred, no drug interactions)
	•	Continue 3-12 months depending on seizure occurrence
	•	EEG if concern for subclinical seizures
Treat Source:
	•	ENT evaluation: Drain sinuses, mastoidectomy if needed
	•	Dental extraction: Odontogenic source
	•	Cardiac surgery: Endocarditis source control
	•	Close skull defects: Prevent reinfection
Prognosis and Complications
Mortality: 5-20% (better with modern imaging and antibiotics)
	•	Higher with: Rupture into ventricle, fungal, multiple abscesses, delayed diagnosis
Complications:
	•	Recurrence: 5-15%, higher with incomplete drainage
	•	Epilepsy: 30-50% long-term (require lifelong AED)
	•	Neurological Deficits: 20-50%, depends on location and damage
	•	Hydrocephalus: Obstructive or communicating
	•	Ventricular rupture: High mortality (50-80%)
Follow-up:
	•	Neurosurgery clinic: 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months
	•	Serial MRI: Every 2-4 weeks until resolution, then every 3 months × 1 year
	•	Complete resolution may take 6-12 months
	•	Persistent enhancement common even after clinical cure
XIX. DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (DVT) IN NEUROSURGICAL PATIENTS
Risk Factors
Patient Factors:
	•	Malignancy (especially brain tumors) - highest risk
	•	Immobilization, paresis, paraplegia
	•	Age >60
	•	Obesity
	•	Prior VTE history
	•	Hypercoagulable states (Factor V Leiden, Protein C/S deficiency)

	•	Warmth, erythema: Over affected area
	•	Palpable cord: Thrombosed superficial vein
	•	Low-grade fever: Phlegmasia
High-Risk Locations:
	•	Proximal DVT: Popliteal, femoral, iliac veins - higher PE risk (50% without treatment)
	•	Distal DVT: Calf veins - lower PE risk (10-20%), may propagate proximally
Asymptomatic: 50% of DVTs clinically silent
Diagnosis
Wells Score for DVT (clinical probability):
	•	Active cancer: +1
	•	Paralysis/paresis/cast: +1
	•	Bedridden >3 days or major surgery within 4 weeks: +1
	•	Tenderness along deep venous system: +1
	•	Entire leg swollen: +1
	•	Calf swelling >3cm compared to other leg: +1
	•	Pitting edema (greater in symptomatic leg): +1

	•	Alternative diagnosis at least as likely: -2
Score Interpretation:
	•	≤0: Low probability (5%)
	•	1-2: Moderate probability (17%)
	•	≥3: High probability (53%)
Diagnostic Tests:
Compression Ultrasonography with Doppler (first-line):
	•	2-point compression: Common femoral and popliteal veins
	•	Complete study: Includes calf veins
	•	Findings:
	•	Loss of compressibility (key finding)
	•	Absence of flow on Doppler
	•	Visible thrombus
	•	Sensitivity: 95% for proximal DVT, 70% for distal DVT
	•	Negative study + low Wells: DVT excluded
	•	Negative study + high Wells: Repeat in 1 week or consider other imaging
D-Dimer:
	•	Limited use in post-op neurosurgical patients (often elevated baseline)
	•	Use in low-probability patients (Wells ≤0)
	•	Age-adjusted cutoff: Age × 10 mcg/L for patients >50
	•	Negative + low probability: Excludes DVT
	•	Positive: Nonspecific, requires imaging
CT or MR Venography:
	•	If ultrasound equivocal
	•	Pelvic/IVC thrombus suspected
	•	Planning IVC filter placement
VTE Prophylaxis in Neurosurgery
Mechanical Prophylaxis (all patients unless contraindicated):
	•	Sequential compression devices (SCDs): Apply in OR, continue until ambulatory
	•	Graduated compression stockings (TED hose): Less effective than SCDs
	•	Early mobilization: Get out of bed POD 1 if safe
Pharmacologic Prophylaxis (timing controversial):
Low Bleeding Risk (e.g., elective spine surgery, chronic SDH drainage):
	•	Start POD 1 if post-op imaging shows no hemorrhage
High Bleeding Risk (craniotomy for tumor, trauma, hemorrhagic stroke):
	•	Delay 24-48 hours post-op
	•	Obtain post-op CT to confirm no hemorrhage before starting
	•	Some protocols wait 72 hours or longer
Standard Regimens:
	•	Enoxaparin (Lovenox) 40 mg SQ daily (preferred)
	•	Dalteparin (Fragmin) 5000 units SQ daily
	•	Heparin 5000 units SQ Q8-12h (if renal impairment, Cr Cl <30)
High-Risk Patients (malignancy, prior VTE):
	•	Consider higher dose: Enoxaparin 30 mg SQ Q12h
	•	Extended prophylaxis: Continue 4 weeks post-op for cancer patients
Contraindications to Pharmacologic Prophylaxis:
	•	Active bleeding
	•	Recent intracranial hemorrhage (<24-72 hours)
	•	Coagulopathy (INR >1.5, platelets <50K)
	•	Spinal hematoma risk (epidural catheter)
	•	Consider IVC filter if DVT high risk and cannot anticoagulate
Treatment of Established DVT
Goals: Prevent PE, prevent propagation, reduce post-thrombotic syndrome
Anticoagulation (if hemorrhage risk acceptable):
Initial Phase (first 5-10 days):
Option 1: LMWH/Fondaparinux:
	•	Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ Q12h OR 1.5 mg/kg SQ daily
	•	Dalteparin (Fragmin) 200 units/kg SQ daily (max 18,000 units)
	•	Fondaparinux: Weight-based dosing
	•	Advantage: Predictable pharmacokinetics, no monitoring, outpatient treatment possible
	•	Monitor: CBC, Cr (dose adjust if Cr Cl <30), anti-Xa levels if needed (obesity, renal impairment)
Option 2: Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) (if renal failure, unstable, or rapid reversal needed):
	•	Bolus: 80 units/kg IV (max 10,000 units)
	•	Infusion: 18 units/kg/hr, adjust to aPTT 1.5-2.5× control (60-80 sec)
	•	Monitoring: aPTT Q6h until therapeutic × 2, then daily
	•	Platelet count: Daily (HIT screening)
Avoid anticoagulation if:
	•	<7 days post-craniotomy for tumor/hemorrhage
	•	Uncontrolled hemorrhage on imaging
	•	Large infarct with hemorrhagic transformation risk
Transition to Oral Anticoagulation:
Warfarin (traditional):
	•	Start Day 1-2 of heparin: 5-10 mg PO daily
	•	Overlap heparin + warfarin ≥5 days AND INR therapeutic (2-3) × 2 consecutive days
	•	Monitor INR: Daily until stable, then weekly
DOACs (Direct Oral Anticoagulants - use with caution post-neurosurgery):
	•	Rivaroxaban: 15 mg PO BID × 21 days, then 20 mg daily
	•	Apixaban: 10 mg PO BID × 7 days, then 5 mg BID
	•	Edoxaban, Dabigatran: Require 5-10 days parenteral anticoagulation first
	•	Advantage: No monitoring, rapid onset
	•	Disadvantage:
	•	Less reversible than warfarin (no established reversal for some)
	•	Not recommended <2-4 weeks post-craniotomy
	•	Avoid if mechanical heart valve, severe renal impairment
Duration of Anticoagulation:
	•	Provoked DVT (post-op, immobilization): 3 months
	•	Unprovoked DVT: 6-12 months (consider extended if low bleeding risk)
	•	Cancer-associated: 3-6 months minimum (often lifelong with cancer), use LMWH over warfarin
	•	Recurrent VTE: Lifelong
IVC Filter
Indications:
	•	Absolute contraindication to anticoagulation: Active intracranial hemorrhage, recent major neurosurgery (<7-14 days)
	•	Failure of anticoagulation: Recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation
	•	Free-floating IVC/iliofemoral thrombus: High embolization risk
	•	Limited cardiopulmonary reserve: Cannot tolerate even small PE
	•	Prophylactic (controversial): Extensive trauma with high VTE risk, cannot use pharmacologic prophylaxis
Types:
	•	Retrievable: Preferred, can remove once able to anticoagulate (ideally <2 weeks, up to 6-12 months depending on device)
	•	Permanent: If lifelong contraindication to anticoagulation
Placement:
	•	IR-guided via femoral or jugular vein
	•	Position: Infrarenal ICA (below renal veins)
	•	Post-procedure: CXR/imaging to confirm position
Anticoagulation with Filter:
	•	Start anticoagulation when safe (filters don't prevent DVT, only PE)
	•	Plan filter retrieval once therapeutic anticoagulation established
Complications:
	•	IVC thrombosis (10-20% long-term)
	•	Filter migration, fracture (rare)
	•	Vessel perforation
	•	Recurrent DVT (filter doesn't prevent clot formation)
Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS)
Definition: Chronic venous insufficiency after DVT
Symptoms (20-50% of DVT patients):
	•	Leg pain, heaviness, fatigue
	•	Swelling (worse with prolonged standing)
	•	Skin changes: Hyperpigmentation, venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis
	•	Venous ulceration (severe cases)
Prevention:
	•	Compression stockings: 30-40 mmHg knee-high × 2 years post-DVT
	•	Adequate anticoagulation (prevent recurrent DVT)
	•	Early mobilization
	•	Leg elevation when resting
XX. PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE)
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms (often subtle, high index of suspicion needed):
	•	Dyspnea: Most common (80%), sudden onset
	•	Pleuritic chest pain: 50%
	•	Cough: 30%, sometimes hemoptysis
	•	Anxiety, sense of impending doom
	•	Syncope: Massive PE (indicates hemodynamic instability)
Signs:
	•	Tachypnea: RR >20 (most common)
	•	Tachycardia: HR >100
	•	Hypoxia: SpO2 <95% on room air
	•	Hypotension: Massive PE
	•	Elevated JVP: Right heart strain
	•	Loud P2: Pulmonary hypertension
Risk Stratification: Same as DVT (immobility, surgery, malignancy)
Diagnosis
Wells Score for PE:
	•	Clinical signs of DVT: +3
	•	PE most likely diagnosis: +3
	•	HR >100: +1.5
	•	Immobilization/surgery in past 4 weeks: +1.5
	•	Previous VTE: +1.5
	•	Hemoptysis: +1
	•	Malignancy: +1
Score:
	•	<2: PE unlikely (10%)
	•	2-6: Moderate probability (30%)
	•	>6: High probability (65%)
Diagnostic Algorithm:
Hemodynamically Stable:
	1	Wells Score + D-Dimer (if low probability)
	•	D-dimer negative + low Wells → PE excluded
	2	CTA Chest (PE protocol):
	•	Positive: Filling defect in pulmonary artery
	•	Negative + high clinical suspicion: V/Q scan or repeat CTA
	•	Proximal vs. subsegmental PE
	3	Lower extremity Doppler: If CTA negative but high suspicion (treat DVT = treat PE)
Hemodynamically Unstable (Massive PE):
	•	Bedside echo: RV dilation, McConnell's sign (RV free wall hypokinesis, apical sparing)
	•	CTA if stable enough for transport
	•	Consider empiric thrombolysis if high suspicion and unstable
Additional Studies:
	•	ABG: Hypoxemia, hypocapnia (respiratory alkalosis), A-a gradient widened
	•	EKG: Sinus tachycardia (most common), S1Q3T3 pattern (classic but rare), right heart strain (RBBB, RV hypertrophy)
	•	Troponin, BNP: Elevated in massive PE (RV strain)
	•	CXR: Usually normal, may show Westermark sign (oligemia), Hampton's hump (wedge infarct), atelectasis
Classification and Risk Stratification
Massive PE (High Risk):
	•	Hemodynamic instability: SBP <90 mmHg or drop >40 mmHg × 15 min
	•	Shock, syncope
	•	RV dysfunction on echo
	•	Mortality: 30-50% without intervention
Submassive PE (Intermediate Risk):
	•	Hemodynamically stable
	•	RV dysfunction on echo/CT OR elevated biomarkers (troponin, BNP)
	•	Mortality: 5-10%
Low-Risk PE:
	•	Stable vitals
	•	Normal RV function
	•	Normal biomarkers
	•	Mortality: <1-2%
PESI Score (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index): Predicts 30-day mortality, helps determine inpatient vs. outpatient treatment
Treatment
Anticoagulation (same as DVT):
Initial: LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux (see DVT section) Long-term: Warfarin or DOAC × 3-6 months minimum
Timing Post-Neurosurgery:
	•	Low-risk PE + recent craniotomy: Balance bleeding vs. clotting risk
	•	Consider IVC filter, delay anticoagulation 7-14 days if possible
	•	High-risk/massive PE: May need to anticoagulate despite bleeding risk (PE mortality > bleeding risk)
	•	Individualized decision with neurosurgery + hematology
Thrombolysis (Massive PE only):
Indications:
	•	Hemodynamic instability (SBP <90, shock)
	•	Cardiac arrest from PE
Regimen:
	•	tPA (Alteplase) 100 mg IV over 2 hours (PE dose)
	•	OR tPA 50 mg IV bolus (off-label, faster)
Contraindications (absolute):
	•	Recent intracranial surgery: <3 weeks (relative: <3 months)
	•	Active intracranial bleeding
	•	Ischemic stroke <3 months
	•	Intracranial neoplasm, AVM, aneurysm
Risk: Intracranial hemorrhage 1-3%, major bleeding 10-20%
Neurosurgical Consultation: Essential before thrombolysis if recent surgery/hemorrhage
Alternatives if Thrombolysis Contraindicated:
	•	Catheter-directed thrombolysis: Lower tPA dose, delivered directly to clot
	•	Mechanical thrombectomy: IR or cardiac cath lab, remove clot mechanically
	•	ECMO: Bridge in massive PE with refractory shock
	•	Surgical embolectomy: Last resort, high mortality
Hemodynamic Support:
	•	Fluids: 500-1000 mL bolus (caution: may worsen RV strain)
	•	Vasopressors: Norepinephrine preferred, maintain MAP >65
	•	Inotropes: Dobutamine if RV dysfunction, low cardiac output
	•	Avoid intubation if possible: Positive pressure worsens RV afterload and preload
	•	Oxygen: Maintain SpO2 >90%
IVC Filter:
	•	Same indications as DVT
	•	Massive PE + contraindication to anticoagulation
Monitoring and Follow-up
Inpatient:
	•	Telemetry (arrhythmias, especially submassive/massive)
	•	Serial vitals, oxygen requirement
	•	Repeat echo if submassive PE (assess RV recovery)

XXII. WOUND COMPLICATIONS
Wound Dehiscence
Definition: Separation of surgical wound layers
Types:
	•	Superficial: Skin/subcutaneous only
	•	Deep: Involves fascia, may expose hardware/bone
	•	Complete: Full-thickness separation
Risk Factors:
	•	Infection
	•	Poor tissue quality (radiation, steroids, malnutrition)
	•	Excessive tension on closure
	•	Hematoma/seroma
	•	Patient factors: Diabetes, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression
Timing:
	•	Early (<1 week): Technical (tension, hematoma)
	•	Late (>1 week): Infection, poor healing
Clinical Presentation:
	•	Visible wound separation
	•	Drainage (serous, purulent if infected)
	•	Pain, erythema
	•	CSF leak if dural breach (clear drainage, salty taste, beta-2 transferrin +)
Management:
Superficial Dehiscence:
	•	Small (<2 cm), clean, no infection:
	•	Wet-to-dry dressings, allow to heal by secondary intention
	•	Close monitoring
	•	Larger or gaping:
	•	Surgical revision: Debridement, primary re-closure
	•	Layered closure with tension-free approximation
Deep Dehiscence:
	•	Emergent surgical repair: Risk of infection, CSF leak, hardware exposure
	•	Debride nonviable tissue
	•	Re-approximate fascia/galea
	•	Drain if needed
	•	Consider rotational flap if poor tissue quality
With CSF Leak:
	•	Immediate repair (high infection risk)
	•	Rule out hydrocephalus (may need shunt/EVD)
	•	Watertight dural closure
	•	Lumbar drain (5-10 cc/hr × 3-5 days) to reduce CSF pressure
	•	Antibiotics (controversial, prophylactic vs. wait for infection)
Bone Flap Exposure:
	•	Salvage: If early, clean, well-perfused tissue - debride and cover
	•	Removal: If infected or devitalized bone - remove, delayed cranioplasty 3-6 months
Postoperative Care:
	•	Strict wound care protocol
	•	Nutritional optimization (protein, albumin >3)
	•	Control diabetes (glucose <180 mg/dL)
	•	Avoid steroids if possible (impair healing)
	•	Wound VAC for large defects (negative pressure therapy)
Wound Infection
Definition: Superficial (skin/SQ) vs. deep (subgaleal, epidural, bone flap)
Timing:
	•	Early (<30 days post-op): Surgical site infection (SSI)
	•	Late (>30 days): Hematogenous seeding, indolent organisms
Risk Factors:
	•	Operative time >4 hours
	•	CSF leak
	•	Re-operation
	•	Bone flap (especially autologous)
	•	Diabetes, steroids, immunosuppression
	•	Nasal/sinus surgery (transsphenoidal)
	•	Poor skin condition (prior radiation, thin skin)
Clinical Presentation:
Superficial Infection:
	•	Erythema, warmth, tenderness along incision
	•	Purulent drainage

	•	Bone flap: Fluctuant, draining, "squishy"
Diagnosis:
Labs:
	•	CBC: Leukocytosis
	•	ESR/CRP: Elevated, trend for response to treatment
	•	Blood cultures: If febrile, concern for bacteremia
	•	Wound culture: Swab purulence or deep tissue biopsy (better than superficial swab)
Imaging:
	•	CT head with contrast: Epidural/subdural empyema, bone flap dehiscence, brain abscess
	•	MRI with contrast: More sensitive for epidural collection, osteomyelitis
	•	Bone scan/WBC scan: Osteomyelitis if chronic
Microbiology:
	•	Early post-op: Staph aureus (MRSA), Staph epidermidis (hardware), Strep
	•	Late/chronic: Propionibacterium acnes (indolent, bone flap), Staph epidermidis
	•	Transsphenoidal: Sinopulmonary flora, anaerobes
Treatment:
Superficial Cellulitis (no abscess):
	•	Empiric antibiotics:
	•	Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID (outpatient)
	•	Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV Q12h (inpatient, MRSA coverage)
	•	Adjust based on culture
	•	Duration: 7-14 days
	•	Close monitoring, may progress to deep infection
Abscess/Deep Infection:
	•	Surgical washout (I&D):
	•	Evacuate pus/necrotic tissue
	•	Copious irrigation (bacitracin, sterile saline)
	•	Debride infected bone if osteomyelitis
	•	Remove hardware if infected (bone flap, mesh, plates) - often cannot salvage
	•	Leave wound open or loosely close with drain
	•	Delayed closure or secondary intention healing
	•	Antibiotics:
	•	Empiric: Vancomycin + cefepime/meropenem
	•	Tailored: Based on intraoperative cultures × 6 weeks
	•	PICC line for prolonged IV therapy
	•	ID consult: Antibiotic selection, duration
Bone Flap Infection/Osteomyelitis:
	•	Remove infected bone flap (cannot clear infection with bone in place)
	•	Store explanted flap: Freezer (-80°C) or subcutaneous abdominal pocket (controversial - often discard)
	•	Antibiotics × 6 weeks minimum
	•	Cranioplasty: Delayed 3-6 months after infection cleared (custom synthetic implant or autologous if stored)
Empyema (epidural/subdural):
	•	Emergent craniotomy, washout, drainage
	•	EVD if ventriculitis
	•	IV antibiotics × 4-6 weeks
Prevention:
	•	Preoperative:
	•	Antibiotics within 60 min of incision (cefazolin 2g, vancomycin if MRSA risk)
	•	Chlorhexidine shower night before
	•	Nasal mupirocin if known MRSA carrier
	•	Intraoperative:
	•	Meticulous hemostasis
	•	Copious irrigation before closure
	•	Re-dose antibiotics if case >4 hours
	•	Minimize operative time
	•	Postoperative:
	•	Keep dressing dry × 48 hours
	•	Remove staples/sutures on time (14 days craniotomy, 10 days spine)
	•	Early recognition and treatment of CSF leak
XXIII. CEREBRAL SALT WASTING (CSW)
Definition and Pathophysiology
Cerebral Salt Wasting: Renal loss of sodium leading to hyponatremia and hypovolemia
Pathophysiology (not fully understood):
	•	Neurologic injury → Increased natriuretic peptides (BNP, ANP)
	•	Inhibition of Na+ reabsorption in proximal tubule
	•	Net sodium loss → volume depletion → hyponatremia
Triggers:
	•	Subarachnoid hemorrhage (most common - 25-30% of SAH patients)
	•	TBI, brain surgery, brain tumors
	•	CNS infections (meningitis, encephalitis)
Timing: Typically days 3-10 post-injury/SAH (peak day 5-7)
Clinical Presentation
Hyponatremia Symptoms:
	•	Mild (130-135 mEq/L): Often asymptomatic, mild headache
	•	Moderate (125-130): Nausea, confusion, weakness
	•	Severe (<125): Lethargy, seizures, coma
Volume Status:
	•	Hypovolemic (KEY differentiator from SIADH):
	•	Dry mucous membranes
	•	Decreased skin turgor
	•	Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia
	•	Low JVP
	•	Decreased urine output (initially, then polyuria)
Diagnosis
Laboratory Criteria:
	•	Serum Na+: <135 mEq/L (often <130)
	•	Serum osmolality: Low (<280 mOsm/kg)
	•	Urine Na+: High (>40 mEq/L) - inappropriate natriuresis despite hypovolemia
	•	Urine osmolality: Appropriately dilute or concentrated (variable)
	•	Uric acid: Low (<4 mg/dL) - from increased renal clearance
	•	BUN/Cr ratio: Elevated (>20) - suggests volume depletion
	•	Hematocrit: Elevated (hemoconcentration from volume loss)
Volume Assessment:
	•	CVP: Low (<8 mmHg if central line present)
	•	Fluid balance: Negative (increased urine output)
	•	Weight: Decreasing
CSW vs. SIADH (Critical Distinction)
Feature
CSW
SIADH
Volume Status

Urine Output
Often increased
Normal to decreased
CVP
Low
Normal to high
BUN
Elevated
Normal to low
Hematocrit

Treatment
Salt + fluid replacement
Fluid restriction
Critical Point: Treating CSW with fluid restriction (SIADH treatment) will worsen hypovolemia and can precipitate vasospasm in SAH patients. Always assess volume status.
Treatment
Goals:
	•	Correct hyponatremia
	•	Restore euvolemia
	•	Prevent complications (vasospasm in SAH)
Salt and Fluid Replacement:
Oral/Enteral (if mild, tolerating PO):
	•	Salt tablets: 1-2 grams PO TID
	•	High-sodium diet, salty foods, broth
	•	Fluid intake: 2-3 L/day of isotonic fluids
IV Therapy (moderate-severe, NPO, or rapid correction needed):
	•	Normal Saline (0.9%): 100-150 mL/hr continuous
	•	Goal: Positive fluid balance, normalize Na+
	•	Hypertonic Saline (3%): If severe symptomatic hyponatremia
	•	Bolus: 100-150 mL over 10-20 min (raises Na+ ~2-3 mEq/L)
	•	Continuous: 15-30 mL/hr, titrate to Na+ correction
	•	Target rate: Raise Na+ by 0.5-1 mEq/L/hr initially, then slower
Fludrocortisone (mineralocorticoid):
	•	Dose: 0.1-0.4 mg PO daily
	•	Enhances renal Na+ reabsorption
	•	Adjunct to fluid/salt replacement
	•	Use if persistent salt wasting despite replacement
Monitoring:
	•	Serum Na+: Q4-6h during active treatment, then Q12h when stable
	•	Strict I/Os: Ensure positive fluid balance
	•	Daily weights
	•	Urine Na+: Daily (should decrease with treatment)
	•	Volume status: CVP if available, clinical exam
Correction Rate (CRITICAL - avoid osmotic demyelination):
	•	Chronic hyponatremia (>48 hrs or unknown duration):
	•	Max correction: 8-10 mEq/L per 24 hours
	•	Overcorrection → Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM)
	•	Acute hyponatremia (<48 hrs) + severe symptoms:
	•	Can correct faster (1-2 mEq/L/hr until symptoms resolve)
	•	Then slow to <8 mEq/L/24hr
Duration:
	•	CSW typically self-limited, resolves over 2-4 weeks
	•	Gradually wean salt/fluids as Na+ stabilizes
	•	May need outpatient salt supplementation × weeks
Complications
Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS):
	•	Cause: Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia (>10-12 mEq/L in 24hr)
	•	Onset: 2-6 days post-correction
	•	Symptoms: Dysarthria, dysphagia, paraparesis, quadriparesis, altered mental status, locked-in syndrome
	•	MRI: Central pontine and/or extrapontine myelinolysis
	•	Treatment: Supportive only (often irreversible)
Prevention: Slow, controlled correction, frequent Na+ monitoring
Vasospasm (in SAH patients):
	•	Hypovolemia from untreated CSW worsens vasospasm risk
	•	Maintain euvolemia critical for vasospasm prevention
XXIV. DIABETES INSIPIDUS (DI) - EXPANDED
(Building on earlier section with additional detail)
Central vs. Nephrogenic DI
Central DI (ADH deficiency):
	•	Neurosurgical causes:
	•	Transsphenoidal surgery (20-30% transient, 5-10% permanent)
	•	Traumatic brain injury (posterior pituitary/stalk injury)
	•	Pituitary tumor, craniopharyngioma
	•	Hypophysectomy
	•	Brain death
	•	Mechanism: Insufficient ADH production
Nephrogenic DI (ADH resistance):
	•	Causes: Lithium, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, chronic kidney disease
	•	Mechanism: Kidneys don't respond to ADH
	•	Rare in neurosurgical patients (rule out with DDAVP challenge)
Triphasic Response (Post-Transsphenoidal)
Phase 1: DI (Days 1-5):
	•	Acute ADH deficiency from surgical trauma
	•	Polyuria, hypernatremia
	•	Treat with DDAVP
Phase 2: SIADH (Days 5-7):
	•	Unregulated ADH release from dying neurons
	•	Hyponatremia, decreased urine output
	•	STOP DDAVP, fluid restrict
Phase 3: Permanent DI (Day 7+):
	•	If >50% posterior pituitary destroyed
	•	Permanent ADH deficiency
	•	Lifelong DDAVP
Not all patients go through all three phases - may have only transient DI
Advanced DI Management
DDAVP Dosing:
Acute (ICU):
	•	IV/SQ: 0.5-2 mcg Q12-24h
	•	Intranasal: 5-10 mcg (50-100 mcL) Q12-24h
	•	Adjust based on urine output and Na+
Chronic (Outpatient):
	•	PO: 0.05-0.1 mg BID-TID (titrate up to 0.8 mg/day if needed)
	•	Intranasal: 5-20 mcg Q12-24h
	•	Goal: Normal urine output (1.5-2.5 L/day), Na+ 135-145
Risks of Over-treatment:
	•	Hyponatremia: From excessive free water retention
	•	SIADH-like picture
	•	Hold DDAVP 1-2 doses per week to allow "breakthrough" polyuria (ensures not over-replaced)
Monitoring:
	•	Acute: Na+ Q4-6h, strict I/Os, urine specific gravity
	•	Chronic: Na+ weekly initially, then monthly, adjust DDAVP dose
Water Deprivation Test (diagnosis if unclear):
	•	Withhold fluids, measure urine osmolality, serum Na+
	•	Give DDAVP, recheck urine osmolality
	•	Central DI: Urine concentrates after DDAVP
	•	Nephrogenic DI: No response to DDAVP
Polyuria Differential (Not Just DI)
Causes of Polyuria in Neurosurgical Patients:
	1	DI: Dilute urine (low specific gravity <1.005, low osmolality <300)
	2	Osmotic diuresis: Mannitol, hyperglycemia (glucose in urine, high osmolality)
	3	Diuretics: Lasix, acetazolamide
	4	Post-obstructive diuresis: After relieving urinary obstruction
	5	CSW: High urine Na+, hypovolemia
	6	Excessive IV fluids: Iatrogenic
Distinguish: Check urine specific gravity, osmolality, Na+, glucose
