# üö® DCS APP ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT PLAN
## From 43.3% to 95%+ Accuracy

**Analysis Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Patient Safety Issue  
**Current Accuracy:** 43.3%  
**Target Accuracy:** 95%+  
**Comparison Baseline:** Gemini (98.6%), OpenAI (92.0%), Claude (91.5%)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Finding
**The DCS app uses the same LLM providers (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini) but achieves only 43.3% accuracy compared to 90%+ for direct API calls.** This dramatic underperformance is NOT due to the LLM quality, but due to:

1. **Over-engineered extraction pipeline** that loses information between phases
2. **Template-based narrative generation** that discards LLM-generated content
3. **Inadequate prompts** that don't explicitly request critical clinical elements
4. **Information loss during orchestration** - data extracted but not passed to narrative
5. **Section validation logic** that may be filtering out correct data

### Root Cause Analysis Summary

| Issue | Root Cause | Impact | Fix Complexity |
|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Missing neurologic recovery | Narrative generation doesn't receive functional status updates | **CRITICAL** | Medium |
| Wrong dates | Prompt doesn't emphasize date accuracy | High | Low |
| Wrong medication dosing | Extraction successful but narrative generation loses precision | High | Low |
| Missing demographics | Prompt doesn't request demographics section | High | Low |
| Missing secondary diagnoses | Narrative template doesn't have secondary diagnoses section | High | Low |
| Missing complications | Prompt doesn't emphasize ALL complications | High | Low |
| Missing discharge destination | Extraction successful but narrative doesn't include it | Medium | Low |

### Key Insight
**Direct LLM calls succeed because they use ONE comprehensive prompt that requests everything.** The DCS app uses a **multi-phase approach** (extract ‚Üí validate ‚Üí generate narrative) where information is lost at each transition.

### Recommended Strategy
**Shift from "extract-then-template" to "guided LLM generation with structured validation"**

---

## PART 1: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Architecture Comparison

#### **Direct LLM Call (Gemini/Claude/OpenAI - 90%+ accuracy)**
```
Clinical Notes ‚Üí Single Comprehensive Prompt ‚Üí Complete Discharge Summary
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No information loss
- ‚úÖ LLM sees full context
- ‚úÖ Natural narrative flow
- ‚úÖ All sections generated together

#### **DCS App Current Architecture (43.3% accuracy)**
```
Clinical Notes ‚Üí Extraction (LLM) ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Narrative Generation (LLM) ‚Üí Output
                     ‚Üì                  ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
              Structured JSON    Filter/Validate    Template-based sections
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Information loss at each transition
- ‚ùå Extraction JSON doesn't capture everything
- ‚ùå Narrative generation receives incomplete data
- ‚ùå Template logic may override LLM output
- ‚ùå Two separate LLM calls don't share context

### 1.2 Specific Code Analysis

#### **Issue #1: Missing Neurologic Recovery (CRITICAL)**

**File:** `src/services/narrativeEngine.js` (lines 103-200)  
**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 723-840)

**Root Cause:**
The narrative generation prompt (line 797-829 in `llmService.js`) requests:
```
6. DISCHARGE STATUS: Functional status (GCS/mRS/KPS), neuro exam, medications, discharge destination
```

But the prompt uses **truncated notes** (line 793):
```javascript
const truncatedNotes = truncateSourceNotes(sourceNotes, 15000);
```

And **concise extracted data** (line 792):
```javascript
const conciseData = summarizeExtractedData(extractedData);
```

The `summarizeExtractedData` function (lines 646-673) creates a summary that includes:
```javascript
discharge_status: {
  destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
  mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
  kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
  gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs
}
```

**But it does NOT include:**
- ‚ùå Detailed neurologic exam findings
- ‚ùå Motor strength by muscle group
- ‚ùå Sensory levels
- ‚ùå Reflex status
- ‚ùå **Late neurologic recovery events**

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
They pass the FULL clinical notes to the LLM in a single prompt, so the LLM sees:
```
POD 20 Progress Note:
Neuro: FINALLY seeing some change!
- L leg: Trace flicker of movement in quad! [1/5]
- R leg: Still [0/5]
- UE: Slightly improved - C8/T1 now [3/5]!
```

The DCS app's truncation logic (lines 679-711) may cut this out, or the `summarizeExtractedData` doesn't capture it.

**Evidence:**
- Gemini, Claude, OpenAI all captured the POD 20 recovery (100% accuracy)
- DCS app stated "Lower extremities 0/5 throughout" (0% accuracy)

---

#### **Issue #2: Wrong Procedure Dates**

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 395-609)

**Root Cause:**
The extraction prompt (lines 395-609) includes chronological intelligence guidance:
```
2. CHRONOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE & DEDUPLICATION:
   - CRITICAL: If "coiling" or any procedure is mentioned in 5 daily notes, this is ONE procedure, not five
   - Identify the ACTUAL procedure date (usually first mention or with explicit date/operator)
```

**But the prompt doesn't emphasize:**
- ‚ùå "Verify dates against note timestamps"
- ‚ùå "Cross-reference POD numbers with admission date"
- ‚ùå "If a date seems wrong, recalculate from POD"

**Example of Failure:**
- Ground truth: I&D performed on **10/04/2025 (POD 14)**
- DCS app output: "October 2, 2025"
- Error: **2 days off**

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
They likely have better date verification logic or the single-pass approach reduces date calculation errors.

---

#### **Issue #3: Wrong Medication Dosing**

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 646-673)

**Root Cause:**
The `summarizeExtractedData` function (line 663-665) summarizes medications as:
```javascript
medications: extracted.medications?.slice(0, 10).map(m =>
  `${m.name || m.medication} ${m.dosage || ''} ${m.frequency || ''}`.trim()
) || [],
```

This creates strings like: `"Oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN"`

**But the narrative generation prompt** (lines 797-829) doesn't emphasize:
- ‚ùå "Preserve exact medication dosages and frequencies"
- ‚ùå "Do not modify medication instructions"
- ‚ùå "Copy medication details verbatim from extracted data"

**Result:** The LLM may "hallucinate" or "correct" the frequency:
- Extracted: `"Oxycodone 5mg q6h PRN"`
- LLM output: `"Oxycodone 5mg q4h PRN"` ‚ùå

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
They extract medications directly from the full notes in a single pass, reducing transcription errors.

---

#### **Issue #4: Missing Demographics**

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 797-829)

**Root Cause:**
The narrative generation prompt does NOT request a demographics/header section:
```
REQUIRED SECTIONS:
1. CHIEF COMPLAINT: 1-2 sentence presenting problem
2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Chronological narrative from symptom onset through admission
3. HOSPITAL COURSE: Day-by-day narrative including procedures, complications, treatment response
4. PROCEDURES: List with dates and operators
5. COMPLICATIONS: If any, describe with management
6. DISCHARGE STATUS: Functional status (GCS/mRS/KPS), neuro exam, medications, discharge destination
7. FOLLOW-UP: Clinic appointments, imaging, instructions
```

**Missing:**
- ‚ùå Patient name
- ‚ùå MRN
- ‚ùå Admission date
- ‚ùå Discharge date
- ‚ùå Length of stay
- ‚ùå Attending physician

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
Their prompts explicitly request:
```
Generate a discharge summary with:
- Patient demographics (name, MRN, age, gender, dates)
- Principal diagnosis
- Secondary diagnoses
- [rest of sections]
```

---

#### **Issue #5: Missing Secondary Diagnoses**

**File:** `src/services/narrativeEngine.js` (lines 103-200)  
**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 797-829)

**Root Cause:**
The narrative generation prompt does NOT request a "Secondary Diagnoses" section. It only requests:
1. Chief Complaint
2. History of Present Illness
3. Hospital Course
4. Procedures
5. Complications
6. Discharge Status
7. Follow-up

**Missing section:** "Secondary Diagnoses" or "Problem List"

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
They explicitly request:
```
Generate a discharge summary with:
- Principal diagnosis
- Secondary diagnoses (all comorbidities and complications)
- [rest of sections]
```

---

#### **Issue #6: Missing Complications (50%)**

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 646-673)

**Root Cause:**
The `summarizeExtractedData` function (lines 659-662) summarizes complications as:
```javascript
complications: extracted.complications?.map(c => ({
  name: c.complication || c.name,
  severity: c.severity
})) || [],
```

**But it doesn't include:**
- ‚ùå Timing (POD)
- ‚ùå Management details
- ‚ùå Resolution status

**And the extraction may have missed complications** if they weren't explicitly labeled as "complications" in the notes.

**Example:**
- Neurogenic shock was mentioned in the notes as "hypotensive and bradycardic, requiring pressors"
- But it may not have been extracted as a "complication" if the word "neurogenic shock" wasn't used

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
They see the full clinical context and can infer complications from clinical descriptions.

---

#### **Issue #7: Missing Discharge Destination**

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js` (lines 646-673)

**Root Cause:**
The `summarizeExtractedData` function (line 667) includes:
```javascript
discharge_status: {
  destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
  ...
}
```

**But the narrative generation prompt** (line 826) only mentions:
```
6. DISCHARGE STATUS: Functional status (GCS/mRS/KPS), neuro exam, medications, discharge destination
```

The prompt doesn't emphasize that discharge destination should be a **prominent, clearly stated section**.

**Result:** The LLM may include it in the discharge status paragraph but not as a clear, standalone statement.

**Why Direct LLM Calls Succeed:**
They have explicit sections for "Disposition" or "Discharge Destination" in their prompts.

---

## PART 2: SPECIFIC CODE FIXES

### Fix #1: Add Demographics Section to Narrative Prompt

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 797-829

**Current Code:**
```javascript
REQUIRED SECTIONS:
1. CHIEF COMPLAINT: 1-2 sentence presenting problem
2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ...
```

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
REQUIRED SECTIONS:
0. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (HEADER):
   - Patient name, MRN, age, gender

             Admission: [Date], Discharge: [Date], LOS: [X] days
             Attending: Dr. [Name]"

1. CHIEF COMPLAINT: 1-2 sentence presenting problem
2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ...
```

**Expected Impact:** +25% accuracy on demographics (0% ‚Üí 100%)

---

### Fix #2: Add Secondary Diagnoses Section

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 797-829

**Current Code:**
```javascript
REQUIRED SECTIONS:
1. CHIEF COMPLAINT: ...
2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ...
3. HOSPITAL COURSE: ...
```

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
REQUIRED SECTIONS:
0. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS: [as above]

1. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Primary reason for admission

2. SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Complete list including:
   - All complications (with timing and resolution status)
   - Comorbidities (pre-existing conditions)
   - Hospital-acquired conditions
   Format as numbered list with details

3. CHIEF COMPLAINT: ...
4. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ...
5. HOSPITAL COURSE: ...
```

**Expected Impact:** +50% accuracy on secondary diagnoses (0% ‚Üí 100%)

---

### Fix #3: Enhance Medication Extraction Guidance

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 797-829

**Add to prompt:**
```javascript
MEDICATION ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract ALL discharge medications with EXACT dosages and frequencies
- Do NOT modify or "correct" medication instructions
- Copy medication details VERBATIM from the notes
- Include route of administration (PO, IV, SQ, etc.)
- Specify duration for time-limited medications (e.g., "x 4 more weeks")
- Format: "Medication name dose route frequency (duration if applicable)"
  Example: "Vancomycin 1g IV q12h x 4 weeks"
```

**Expected Impact:** +40% accuracy on medications (60% ‚Üí 100%)

---

### Fix #4: Emphasize Date Verification

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 395-609 (extraction prompt)

**Add to extraction prompt:**
```javascript
DATE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:
- Cross-reference all dates with note timestamps
- Verify POD calculations: POD X = Admission Date + X days
- If a procedure date seems inconsistent, recalculate from POD
- Format all dates as YYYY-MM-DD
- Double-check: Does "POD 14" match the stated date?
```

**Expected Impact:** +15% accuracy on dates (85% ‚Üí 100%)

---

### Fix #5: Enhance Functional Status Extraction

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 646-673 (summarizeExtractedData function)

**Current Code:**
```javascript
discharge_status: {
  destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
  mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
  kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
  gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs
}
```

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
discharge_status: {
  destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
  mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
  kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
  gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs,
  // ADD DETAILED NEUROLOGIC EXAM
  neuro_exam: {
    motor: extracted.discharge?.motorExam || extracted.functionalScores?.motorExam,
    sensory: extracted.discharge?.sensoryExam || extracted.functionalScores?.sensoryExam,
    reflexes: extracted.discharge?.reflexes || extracted.functionalScores?.reflexes,
    cranial_nerves: extracted.discharge?.cranialNerves,
    // CRITICAL: Include any late recovery events
    recovery_events: extracted.discharge?.recoveryEvents || []
  }
}
```

**AND update narrative prompt to emphasize:**
```javascript
6. DISCHARGE STATUS:
   - Detailed neurological examination (motor strength by muscle group, sensory level, reflexes)
   - Functional scores (GCS, mRS, KPS, ASIA if applicable)
   - **CRITICAL: Document any late neurologic recovery or improvement**
   - Discharge medications (complete list with exact dosages)
   - Discharge destination
```

**Expected Impact:** +37.5% accuracy on functional status (62.5% ‚Üí 100%)

---

## PART 3: ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Single-Pass LLM Generation (RECOMMENDED)

**Approach:** Use ONE comprehensive LLM call to generate the complete discharge summary directly from clinical notes.

**Architecture:**
```
Clinical Notes ‚Üí Single Comprehensive Prompt ‚Üí Complete Discharge Summary ‚Üí Structured Parsing
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No information loss
- ‚úÖ Matches Gemini/Claude/OpenAI approach (90%+ accuracy)
- ‚úÖ Simpler codebase
- ‚úÖ Faster (one LLM call instead of two)
- ‚úÖ Better narrative coherence

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less structured extraction (but can parse output)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to validate individual fields
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need post-processing to extract structured data

**Implementation:**
1. Create new comprehensive prompt that requests ALL sections
2. Parse LLM output into structured sections
3. Extract structured data from narrative (reverse extraction)
4. Validate completeness

**Estimated Accuracy:** 90-95%

---

### Option B: Enhanced Two-Phase Approach (CURRENT + FIXES)

**Approach:** Keep current architecture but fix information loss issues.

**Architecture:**
```
Clinical Notes ‚Üí Enhanced Extraction ‚Üí Enhanced Narrative Generation ‚Üí Output
                        ‚Üì                          ‚Üì
                 Complete JSON           Full context + extracted data
```

**Changes:**
1. **Don't truncate notes** for narrative generation
2. **Don't summarize extracted data** - pass full extraction
3. **Enhance prompts** with all missing sections
4. **Add validation** to ensure all sections present

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Maintains structured extraction
- ‚úÖ Easier to validate
- ‚úÖ Can leverage existing code
- ‚úÖ Incremental improvement

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still two LLM calls (slower, more expensive)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of information loss remains
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex codebase

**Estimated Accuracy:** 85-90%

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (BEST OF BOTH)

**Approach:** Use single-pass LLM for narrative, then extract structured data from narrative.

**Architecture:**
```
Clinical Notes ‚Üí Comprehensive LLM Generation ‚Üí Complete Narrative
                                                        ‚Üì
                                                 Parse & Extract
                                                        ‚Üì
                                              Structured Data + Narrative
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Best narrative quality (single-pass)
- ‚úÖ Structured data available (parsed from narrative)
- ‚úÖ Simpler than two-phase
- ‚úÖ Matches successful approach

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Parsing may miss some structured data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires robust parsing logic

**Estimated Accuracy:** 92-98%

---

## RECOMMENDATION: Option C (Hybrid Approach)

**Rationale:**
1. Matches the approach used by Gemini/Claude/OpenAI (90%+ accuracy)
2. Simpler than current two-phase approach
3. Better narrative quality
4. Can still extract structured data for UI

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Create comprehensive single-pass prompt
2. Generate complete narrative
3. Parse narrative into sections
4. Extract structured data from narrative
5. Validate completeness

## CONCLUSION

The DCS app's 43.3% accuracy is **NOT due to LLM quality** but due to **architectural issues** that cause information loss. By implementing the fixes outlined in this plan, we can achieve 95%+ accuracy within 4 weeks.

**Key Takeaway:** Simplify the architecture, enhance the prompts, and trust the LLM to generate comprehensive discharge summaries in a single pass.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Week 1)
3. Test with Robert Chen case
4. Proceed to Phase 2 and 3
