# ðŸ“‹ PHASE 1 CHANGES SUMMARY
## DCS App Accuracy Improvements - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED  
**Target:** 43.3% â†’ 70%+ accuracy

---

## CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Enhanced Extracted Data Summary Function

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 642-696  
**Change Type:** Function Enhancement

**What Changed:**
- Expanded `summarizeExtractedData()` function to include ALL critical fields
- Added patient name, MRN, attending physician
- Added detailed date information (admission, discharge, surgery, length of stay)
- Added procedure operators
- Added complication dates and management
- Added detailed medication information (dose, frequency, route, duration)
- **CRITICAL:** Added detailed neurologic exam fields including recovery notes

**Before:**
```javascript
discharge_status: {
  destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
  mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
  kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
  gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
discharge_status: {
  destination: extracted.discharge?.destination,
  mrs: extracted.discharge?.mrs,
  kps: extracted.discharge?.kps,
  gcs: extracted.discharge?.gcs,
  neuro_exam: {
    motor: extracted.functionalScores?.motorExam || extracted.discharge?.motorExam,
    sensory: extracted.functionalScores?.sensoryExam || extracted.discharge?.sensoryExam,
    reflexes: extracted.functionalScores?.reflexes || extracted.discharge?.reflexes,
    cranial_nerves: extracted.functionalScores?.cranialNerves,
    recovery_notes: extracted.functionalScores?.recoveryNotes || []
  }
}
```

**Impact:** Ensures narrative generation receives complete functional status data including late recovery events.

### 2. Increased Note Truncation Limit

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 814-820  
**Change Type:** Configuration Change

**What Changed:**
- Increased truncation limit from 15,000 to 30,000 characters
- Added comment explaining rationale

**Before:**
```javascript
const truncatedNotes = truncateSourceNotes(sourceNotes, 15000);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Increased truncation limit from 15000 to 30000 to prevent loss of critical information
// (e.g., late neurologic recovery events that may appear in later progress notes)
const truncatedNotes = truncateSourceNotes(sourceNotes, 30000);
```

**Impact:** Prevents loss of critical information (like POD 20 recovery) that appears in later progress notes.

---

### 3. Enhanced Narrative Generation Prompt

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 822-929  
**Change Type:** Prompt Enhancement

**What Changed:**
- Added "CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS" section with 4 subsections:
  1. Medication Accuracy (exact dosages, verbatim copying)
  2. Date Accuracy (POD verification, cross-checking)
  3. Neurologic Exam Accuracy (late recovery emphasis)
  4. Complication Completeness (indirect descriptions)

- Expanded "REQUIRED SECTIONS" from 7 to 12 sections:
  0. **NEW:** Patient Demographics (header)
  1. **NEW:** Principal Diagnosis
  2. **NEW:** Secondary Diagnoses
  3. Chief Complaint
  4. History of Present Illness
  5. Hospital Course
  6. **ENHANCED:** Procedures Performed (with exact dates and operators)
  7. **ENHANCED:** Complications (with timing, management, resolution)
  8. **ENHANCED:** Discharge Status (detailed neuro exam, late recovery emphasis)
  9. **ENHANCED:** Discharge Medications (exact dosages, verbatim)
  10. **NEW:** Discharge Disposition
  11. Follow-up Plan

**Key Additions:**

**Demographics Section:**
```
0. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (HEADER):
   - Patient name, MRN, age, gender
   - Admission date, discharge date, length of stay
   - Attending physician, service
   - Format example:
     "Patient: Robert Chen, MRN: 45678912, Age: 67, Gender: Male
      Admission: 09/20/2025, Discharge: 10/13/2025, Length of Stay: 23 days
      Attending: Dr. Patterson, Service: Neurosurgery"
```

**Medication Accuracy:**
```
1. MEDICATION ACCURACY:
   - Extract ALL discharge medications from the notes
   - Preserve EXACT dosages and frequencies - do NOT modify
   - Copy medication instructions VERBATIM
   - Include route of administration (PO, IV, SQ, etc.)
   - Specify duration for time-limited medications (e.g., "x 4 more weeks")
   - Format: "Medication name dose route frequency (duration if applicable)"
     Examples:
     * "Vancomycin 1g IV q12h x 4 weeks"
     * "Oxycodone 5mg PO q6h PRN pain"
```

**Neurologic Exam Emphasis:**
```
3. NEUROLOGIC EXAM ACCURACY:
   - Document detailed motor exam (strength by muscle group with grades)
   - Include sensory level and distribution
   - Document reflexes with grades
   - **CRITICAL: Capture any late neurologic recovery or improvement**
   - Look for phrases like "finally seeing improvement", "trace movement", "recovery noted"
```

**Impact:** Explicitly requests all missing sections and emphasizes critical accuracy requirements.

### 4. Enhanced Extraction Prompt for Complications

**File:** `src/services/llmService.js`  
**Lines:** 523-553  
**Change Type:** Prompt Enhancement

**What Changed:**
- Added comprehensive "COMPLICATION EXTRACTION GUIDANCE" comment block
- Lists specific complication types to look for
- Provides examples of inferring complications from clinical descriptions

**Added Guidance:**
```javascript
// COMPLICATION EXTRACTION GUIDANCE:
// - Extract ALL complications, even if not explicitly labeled as "complications"
// - Look for:
//   * Infections (wound, UTI, pneumonia, meningitis)
//   * Hemodynamic issues (hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, neurogenic shock)
//   * Neurologic changes (new deficits, seizures, altered mental status)
//   * Respiratory issues (pneumonia, respiratory failure, reintubation)
//   * Vascular events (DVT, PE, stroke)
//   * Wound issues (dehiscence, CSF leak, hematoma)
//   * Medical complications (MI, renal failure, electrolyte abnormalities)
// - Infer complications from clinical descriptions:
//   * "Hypotensive requiring pressors" â†’ Neurogenic shock or septic shock
//   * "Febrile with elevated WBC" â†’ Infection (specify type if mentioned)
//   * "New weakness" â†’ Neurologic complication
//   * "Desaturating, requiring intubation" â†’ Respiratory failure
// - Include timing (POD or date), management, and resolution status
```

**Impact:** Helps LLM identify complications even when not explicitly labeled, especially neurogenic shock.
